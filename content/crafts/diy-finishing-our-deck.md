It was difficult to title this post and, as I type, I'm sure I'll come up with another iteration. For whatever reason, whoever built our deck left this gap open by the utility room steps. There was a big plant there that I removed and that's really the only reason I can think of leaving the space in the first place. I thought it was dangerous as it would be easy to step right off and into the hole as there weren't any guard rails added. Just another example of new homeowners complaining about what the previous owners did. I'm sure whoever buys our house in the future will complain too.

Anyway, this spot has really been bothering me. The deck is small, and having that large gap is a terrible use of space. I decided I was going to fill it and put a potting bench on top as it would be nice to be right by the door in case I needed anything from the garage as I messed with my plants. It's also right by a hose for easy watering.

I tried to make this as simple as possible. I've never built a deck before, but how hard could a little section be?

Here's what I did:

## Supplies

1. Lumber (four 1x6s @ 4ft each)
2. More lumber (four 4x4s @ 1ft each)
3. Screws
4. Drill
5. Miter saw
6. Ruler and/or speed square
7. Paint to match deck
