It was difficult to title this post and, as I type, I'm sure I'll come up with another iteration. For whatever reason, whoever built our deck left this gap open by the utility room steps. There was a big plant there that I removed and that's really the only reason I can think of leaving the space in the first place. I thought it was dangerous as it would be easy to step right off and into the hole as there weren't any guard rails added. Just another example of new homeowners complaining about what the previous owners did. I'm sure whoever buys our house in the future will complain too.

Anyway, this spot has really been bothering me. The deck is small, and having that large gap is a terrible use of space. I decided I was going to fill it and put a potting bench on top as it would be nice to be right by the door in case I needed anything from the garage as I messed with my plants. It's also right by a hose for easy watering.

I tried to make this as simple as possible. I've never built a deck before, but how hard could a little section be?

Here's what I did:

## Supplies

 1. Lumber (three 1x6s @ 4ft each) <-Deck
 2. More lumber (eight 2x4s @ 1ft each) <-Legs
 3. Even more lumber (2 pieces of scrap @ 16in each) <-Spines to connect deck pieces
 4. Screws
 5. Drill
 6. Miter saw
 7. Ruler and/or speed square
 8. Paint to match the deck
 9. Safety glasses
10. Earmuffs

## Process

Note before we begin: I know I forget to write down safety supplies sometimes, but it's so important to wear the proper gear. Your eyes and ears will thank you.

Alright!

This is a relatively simple project, as most of my DIYs seem to be lately. I finished in an afternoon and the longest steps were waiting for glue and paint to dry.

Step one is drawing up a plan with approximate measurements. Sizes will be different for everyone, but the gap I needed to fill was about 4ft by 16inches.
