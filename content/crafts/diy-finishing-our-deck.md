It was difficult to title this post and, as I type, I'm sure I'll come up with another iteration. For whatever reason, whoever built our deck left this gap open by the utility room steps. There was a big plant there that I removed and that's really the only reason I can think of leaving the space in the first place. I thought it was dangerous as it would be easy to step right off and into the hole as there weren't any guard rails added. Just another example of new homeowners complaining about what the previous owners did. I'm sure whoever buys our house in the future will complain too.

Anyway, this spot has really been bothering me. The deck is small, and having that large gap is a terrible use of space. I decided I was going to fill it and put a potting bench on top as it would be nice to be right by the door in case I needed anything from the garage as I messed with my plants. It's also right by a hose for easy watering.

I tried to make this as simple as possible. I've never built a deck before, but how hard could a little section be?

Here's what I did:

## Supplies

 1. Lumber (three 1x6s @ 4ft each) <-Deck
 2. More lumber (eight 2x4s @ 1ft each) <-Legs
 3. Even more lumber (2 pieces of scrap @ 16in each) <-Spines to connect deck pieces
 4. [Deck screws](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Deck-Plus-10-x-3-in-Ceramic-Deck-Screws-40-Count/1001363866) (3in)
 5. Drill
 6. Miter saw
 7. Wood glue
 8. Clamps
 9. Ruler and/or speed square
10. Paint to match the deck
11. Safety glasses
12. Earmuffs

## Process

Note before we begin: I know I forget to write down safety supplies sometimes, but it's so important to wear the proper gear. Your eyes and ears will thank you.

Alright!

This is a relatively simple project, as most of my DIYs seem to be lately. I finished in an afternoon and the longest steps were waiting for glue and paint to dry.

Step one is drawing up a plan with approximate measurements. Sizes will be different for everyone, but the gap I needed to fill was about 4ft by 16inches.

To be honest, the real step one was ripping a huge plant out of the space so I could actually drop an insert in there. Feel free to watch that process in the video.

After my plan was done, it was time to head to Lowe's and get some materials. In this case, it was a lot of wood and I somehow got four 8ft pieces to fit in my car. Who needs a truck? Be sure to use weather-treated lumber as this is going to sit outside forever.

Step two is measuring out all your pieces. All of mine are on the supply list. Originally, I was going to use 4x4s for the legs, but they didn't have the kind I needed so I ended up buying two 4ft 2x4s, cutting them into 1ft pieces, and gluing two pieces together to create four legs. Worked just fine and was cheaper.

Step three is to make all your cuts. A miter saw makes quick work of all this wood and it only took me a few minutes between measuring and cutting. I then glued and clamped my legs together and gave the glue an hour to set.
