It was difficult to title this post and, as I type, I'm sure I'll come up with another iteration. For whatever reason, whoever built our deck left this gap open by the utility room steps. There was a big plant there that I removed and that's really the only reason I can think of leaving the space in the first place. I thought it was dangerous as it would be easy to step right off and into the hole.
