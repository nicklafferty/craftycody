I decided to go really simple with this one as I don’t have a lot of subscribers and everyone is complaining about the YouTube algorithm these days. I don’t suspect that my channel will blow up any time soon, so I’m just going to make what I enjoy doing: simple, little crafts that are easy to follow along with. Enjoy!
