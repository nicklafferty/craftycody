I mentioned in my [last IKEA post](https://craftycody.com/crafts/doors-ikea-kallax/) that I have several kallax shelving units in my house and I've had them all for years. I hate getting rid of perfectly good furniture just to buy something new, so I decided to start updating what I had. I've already put a set of doors on one kallax, so now it's time to move on to the one in my sunroom.
