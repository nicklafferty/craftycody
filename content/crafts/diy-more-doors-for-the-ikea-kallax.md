+++
I mentioned in my [last IKEA post](https://craftycody.com/crafts/doors-ikea-kallax/) that I have several kallax shelving units in my house and I've had them all for years. I hate getting rid of perfectly good furniture just to buy something new, so I started updating what I had. I've already put a set of doors on one kallax, so now it's time to move on to the one in my sunroom.

These doors will be a little bigger than the ones I made for my tv stand. Basically, I'll be doubling the size of each door and only adding two to the kallax instead of four. I wanted it to look a little different than the one in the living room. I also won't be staining or painting these doors, however, you easily could if you wanted.

This project should go even faster than my last one since there will be less cutting and I kind of know what I'm doing now. I think the hardest part will be finding cabinet pulls I like.

## Supplies:

1. Wood (1x3s)
2. Miter saw
3. Drill
4. Sander
5. Stain/Paint if needed
6. Burlap/Rattan/Fabric of choice
7. Stapler
8. Cabinet pulls
9. Safety gear
