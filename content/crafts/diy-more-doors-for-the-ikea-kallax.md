You can find PDF plans for all of my IKEA hacks and more on [my Etsy page](https://www.etsy.com/shop/CodysCraftyCo).

Google Analytics sends me some data each month. It doesn't go into a lot of detail, but I get to see the broad strokes of how my website is doing and I'm steadily going up in the charts. One thing I pay attention to is what people are searching for when they click on my website and it has become apparent that everyone wants more IKEA hacks. So here we go.

I mentioned in my [last IKEA post](https://craftycody.com/crafts/doors-ikea-kallax/) that I have several kallax shelving units in my house and I've had them all for years. I hate getting rid of perfectly good furniture just to buy something new, so I started updating what I had. I've already put a set of doors on one kallax, so now it's time to move on to the one in my sunroom.

These doors will be a little bigger than the ones I made for my tv stand. Basically, I'll be doubling the size of each door and only adding two to the kallax instead of four. I wanted it to look a little different than the one in the living room. I also won't be staining or painting these doors, however, you easily could if you wanted.

I guess this would count as an IKEA hack. I have one more kallax after this one and will more than likely be adding doors to it as well. Maybe I can come up with something a little more special since it's a 2x2 cubby unit.

This project should go even faster than my last one since there will be less cutting and I kind of know what I'm doing now. I think the hardest part will be finding cabinet pulls I like.

Let's get started.

## Supplies:

 1. Wood (1x3s)
 2. [Miter saw](https://amzn.to/3zYLXCU)
 3. [Drill](https://amzn.to/3BHcK83)
 4. [Sander](https://amzn.to/3zzE71q)
 5. Wood glue
 6. Clamps
 7. Stain/Paint if needed
 8. [Burlap](https://amzn.to/3oTgz2m)/Rattan/Fabric of choice
 9. Stapler
10. Hinges (x4)
11. Cabinet pulls (x2)
12. Safety gear

## How-to:

### Cut list

We're going to be using a little less wood here than my last IKEA project. The vertical pieces will be 24-inches like before, but the horizontal pieces will be 27.5-inches. I bought three 6-foot pieces of lumber and one 4-foot piece to accommodate all the cuts.

**1x3s:**  
24-in (x4)  
27\.5-in (x4)
