I just finished blogging about my [vacation to South Padre](https://craftycody.com/life/south-padre-tx/) and mentioned how beautiful the beach was. Well, it was also FULL of shells!

We went to Miami earlier this summer and the few shells I found were all broken, but on South Padre, there was almost an infinite amount of pristine shells to pick up and take home.

I love souvenirs, but I don't love a lot of knickknacks to dust, so I've had to get creative when displaying memories from trips. Usually, it ends up being photos, which is fine, but every once in a while it's fun to have a physical reminder of a great vacation.

I collected a bag full of shells and brought them home, but didn't know quite what to do with them. I'm not the biggest fan of beach decor and I didn't want to go too far in that direction. At first, I thought to simply pour them into a glass vase and call it a day, but that seemed a little boring and wouldn't make a great how-to video.

So I did a little searching and got the idea to use mason jars. Then, my brain took care of the rest.

I decided to use some nautical rope, white sand, fake pearls, and my shells to create little vignettes inside the jars. It's a very simple and affordable craft that you can do to remember any beach vacation.
