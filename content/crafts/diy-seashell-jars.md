I just finished blogging about my [vacation to South Padre](https://craftycody.com/life/south-padre-tx/) and mentioned how beautiful the beach was. Well, it was also FULL of shells!

We went to Miami earlier this summer and the few shells I found were all broken, but on South Padre, there was almost an infinite amount of pristine shells to pick up and take home.
