Some super simple DIYs up for you this week on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYEjfsNAqG2_csAC7FDUYcg). Be sure to subscribe and let me know what you’d like to see next!

We’re making a candle (sort of), a candle holder, and a small wreath to start out. Hoping to have some bigger and better DIYs in the future.
