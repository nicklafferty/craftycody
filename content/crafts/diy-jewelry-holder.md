I'll be honest, my jewelry storage was pretty pathetic. I put together what I thought was a cute idea years ago and have been dealing with it ever since. It's heavy and, admittedly, ugly. I can't really hang it anywhere anymore because I always knock into it and it's hard to get the piece of jewelry I want off of it. It's too bulky and can't hold all of the jewelry I've accumulated over the years. What isn't hanging off of my wooden monstrosity is just hidden away in drawers.

I needed something better.

So after some Googling, I found a few ideas for jewelry storage I really liked. I don't have room for a traditional jewelry box of any size so I need to utilize wall space which I have plenty of.

Eventually, I came across one that I instantly loved and knew I could build myself. We don't need many materials for this project at all making it beginner (and budget!) friendly. All of the materials cost about $20 and it was because I got a big pack of cup hooks which was $7 on its own.

Let's get started!

## Supplies:

 1. 2x4x2 pine (x2)
 2. 3/8-in oak dowels (x2 @ 36-inches long)
 3. [7/8-in cup hooks](https://amzn.to/3Iu8Gv1) (for necklaces)
 4. [Keyhole fasteners](https://amzn.to/3k0qSDd) (x2)
 5. Miter saw
 6. Drill/Impact Driver
 7. 3-inch wood screws (x2)
 8. Sander
 9. Planer
10. Wood glue
11. Ruler and speed square
12. Stain (if needed)
13. Poly
14. Safety gear

## How-to:

### Step 1:

This is going to be another project that you can completely customize. I'll be using my dimensions, but you can make this any size you need.

I started off with two 2x4x2 from Lowe's. You can grab a 4ft board, but they were out of stock so I bought two 2ft boards. I went ahead and did some sanding and planed before getting started.

I decided not to cut them down any further since I liked the 2ft length. I used my miter saw to cut 30-degree angles on each of the ends. You'll need to chop a little off from the board you use as the bottom piece so the triangle will look "even". Cut one angle about 1.5 inches in to achieve this.

### Step 2:

Next, we're going to sand again. Get all the splinters off of your boards and smooth out any plane lines.

Using some wood glue, I glued my jewelry holder together to form the triangle. Make sure the end grain from the top piece is facing down because we don't want it to look weird on the side. I let this dry overnight.

### Step 3:

I predrilled some screw holes with a 1/8-inch bit to create guides for my screws. I used 3-inch long wood screws to secure my two boards together.

I sanded everything off again to get rid of any splinters from drilling and to remove dried glue that smooshed out.

If you'd like to paint or stain your jewelry holder, now is the time.

### Step 4:

Time to size and cut the dowels. I wanted them to mimic the shape of the triangle and gradually get longer as they went down. Make them as long as you need to fit your jewelry. I eyeballed everything.

After they were cut, I gave them a light sanding on their ends then stained them in red mahogany.

### Step 5:

Drilling the holes for the dowels was easily the most time-consuming part. I suggest getting a drill guide to help your drill go in straight otherwise you'll have to shape your holes repeatedly to make sure the dowels are parallel with the base.

A trick that might help is using one of the scrap off-cuts from step one. They'll be 30 degrees as well and you can use a drill guide in conjunction with one to make sure the angle of the drill is correct.

Anyway, after drilling I made sure all of the dowels went in and were sitting how I wanted them to. Then, I took some (a lot of) wood glue and filled the holes then slid the dowels into each. I used a mallet and my drill to hold them in place while the glue dried.

Wait 24 hours to really let that glue cure. You can use wood filler for any gaps from the drill.

### Step 6:

Now it's time to add the keyhole fasteners. I placed one near the top of the triangle and the second one directly under it on the base.

### Step 7:

The last building step is adding the cup hooks along the bottom. Predrill small holes to make screwing these in by hand a ton easier. I drew a straight line down the middle of the base so I could evenly space them.
