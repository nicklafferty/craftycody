I'll be honest, right now my jewelry storage is pathetic. I put together what I thought was a cute idea years ago and have been dealing with it ever since. It's heavy and, admittedly, ugly. I can't really hang it anywhere anymore. It's too bulky and can't hold all of the jewelry I've accumulated over the years. What isn't hanging off of my wooden monstrosity is just hidden away in drawers.

I needed something better.

So after some Googling, I found a few ideas for jewelry storage I really liked. I don't have room for a traditional jewelry box of any size so I need to utilize wall space which I have plenty of.

I found one that I instantly loved and knew I could build myself. We don't need many materials for this project at all making it beginner (and budget!) friendly.

Let's get started!
