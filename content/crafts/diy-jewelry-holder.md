I'll be honest, right now my jewelry storage is all but nonexistent. I put together what I thought was a cute idea years ago and have been dealing with it ever since. It's heavy and, admittedly, ugly. I can't really hang it anywhere anymore. It's too bulky and can't hold all of the jewelry I've accumulated over the years.

So after some Googling, I found a few ideas for jewelry storage I really liked. I don't have room for a traditional jewelry box of any size so I need to utilize wall space which I have plenty of.
