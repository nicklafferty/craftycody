Pets are the new kids and plants are the new pets.

I live and die by these words.

And our little plant friends deserve cute, little houses that also go well with our boho or farmhouse decor, right? So right.

Today I made a charming planter box from scrap wood. All you need is a piece of scrap and a few common tools.

## Supplies:

 1. Scrap wood (I used a \~25-in 1x3)
 2. Saw (I used a jigsaw, but you could hand saw if needed)
 3. Ruler and speed square
 4. Sander (you can sand by hand)
 5. Wood glue
 6. Clamps
 7. Nails
 8. Hammer
 9. Drill (for drainage hole)
10. Pencil
11. Sealer
12. Stain (optional)

## Process:

I dug around in my wood box for a small, but not too small, piece of wood and landed on an old 1x3 from a finished project. It was about 25 inches long, but not quite.

Measure out your piece and divide by 5 (4 sides and the bottom). The fractions I was dealing with were nuts, so I cut 4 pieces at 4 1/8" and my last piece was 5 inches long and had to be trimmed down so it wouldn't extend past the planter. You're probably going to want that bottom piece to be a touch longer than the other 4 just to make sure it will span the width of the planter.

I measured with a tape measure then drew my cut lines on with a speed square so that they would be straight. Then, I got to cutting which is the fastest part.

With my 5 pieces cut, I got to sanding. Got rid of all the splintery bits and rounded off the edges that would be the top and bottom. It gives it a cute look but is purely aesthetic.

I glued and clamped the edges together and let them dry for 30 minutes.
