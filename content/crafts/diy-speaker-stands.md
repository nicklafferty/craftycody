We are _finally_ glowing up our living room. Recently, we purchased our first couch that wasn't a hand-me-down and bought accent chairs on a whim. We also got this funky ottoman, but it isn't going to be here for a few weeks. The room is finally getting a personality and I'm really excited about it.

So excited, in fact, that my enthusiasm for building furniture has been reignited and I've decided to revamp the remaining pieces in our living room to create a cohesive and grown-up look. I'm going to be starting simple with some easy speaker stands.

When it comes to optimizing the audio quality of your home theater or music system, having the right speaker stands can make a world of difference. Not only do they provide a stable and secure platform for your speakers, but they can also help to reduce vibrations and improve sound clarity. However, if you're like me, finding the perfect _anything_ for your space and budget can be a challenge. I'll show you how to make your own customized stands that not only meet your specific needs but also add a touch of personal style to your setup- as well as a little bit of added storage! Whether you're an audiophile looking for the perfect acoustic solution or just someone who wants to upgrade their home entertainment system, this guide will walk you through the step-by-step process of building your very own speaker stands.

Let's get started!

## Supplies:

 1. Wood (x4 2x4x92 5/8)
 2. Miter saw
 3. Dowels
 4. Drill
 5. Drill guide
 6. Wood glue
 7. Clamps
 8. Sander
 9. Electric planer
10. Stain/paint
11. Safety gear

## How-to:

The first thing to note is the odd-sized wood I bought. I found the cheapest 2x4s that Lowe's had and they happen to be 92 5/8-in long instead of the standard 8 feet. I thought this was weird, but it ended up working out fine in terms of the sizes of pieces I'd need to complete this project. It also kept my costs down to about $13 total for the wood.
