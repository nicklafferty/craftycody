We are _finally_ glowing up our living room. Recently, we purchased our first couch that wasn't a hand-me-down and bought accent chairs on a whim. We also got this funky ottoman, but it isn't going to be here for a few weeks. The room is finally getting a personality and I'm really excited about it.

So excited, in fact, that my enthusiasm for building furniture has been reignited and I've decided to revamp the remaining pieces in our living room to create a cohesive and grown-up look. I'm going to be starting simple with some easy speaker stands.

When it comes to optimizing the audio quality of your home theater or music system, having the right speaker stands can make a world of difference. Not only do they provide a stable and secure platform for your speakers, but they can also help to reduce vibrations and improve sound clarity. However, if you're like me, finding the perfect _anything_ for your space and budget can be a challenge. I'll show you how to make your own customized stands that not only meet your specific needs but also add a touch of personal style to your setup- as well as a little bit of added storage! Whether you're an audiophile looking for the perfect acoustic solution or just someone who wants to upgrade their home entertainment system, this guide will walk you through the step-by-step process of building your very own speaker stands.

Let's get started!

## Supplies:

 1. Wood (x4 2x4x92 5/8)
 2. Miter saw
 3. Dowels
 4. Drill
 5. Drill guide
 6. Wood glue
 7. Clamps
 8. Sander
 9. Electric planer
10. Flush cut saw
11. Rubber mallet
12. Ruler/speed square
13. Stain/paint
14. Safety gear

## How-to:

The first thing to note is the odd-sized wood I bought. I found the cheapest 2x4s that Lowe's had and they happen to be 92 5/8-in long instead of the standard 8 feet. I thought this was weird, but it ended up working out fine in terms of the sizes of pieces I'd need to complete this project. It also kept my costs down to about $13 total for the wood.

### Step 1:

We're going to be cutting a _lot_ of wood today. We'll need six pieces at 24-in long and six pieces at 11 1/4-in long. These will make up the sides, top, and bottom of your speaker stand.

The shelf consists of

The "spine" on the back of the speaker stand will be

I cut all of my pieces to length, then pivoted my miter saw to 45 degrees and made the angled cuts into all pieces EXCEPT those used for the shelf and spine. Be sure to cut slowly to minimize chips and splinters.

### Step 2:

This will be a time-consuming step. We're going to plane and then sand _all_ of our pieces. This wood is kind of cheap so it's gnarly and damaged. The planer will help with broad-strokes smoothing and then sanding afterward will get rid of tiny splinters and debris. I typically keep my hand planer on the first tick after zero so it's only taking a thin layer of wood off after each pass.

Take your time to make sure all of your pieces are nice and smooth.

### Step 3:

Time to glue and clamp (most) everything together. Let's grab two side pieces as well as a top and a bottom piece. Add some glue to the 45-degree cuts and clamp them together. We're going to make three of these frames.

Go ahead and glue the shelving boards together along their edges and clamp them. Let everything dry for 24 hours.

When the large frame pieces have dried we're going to drill pilot holes for our dowels to fit into. Use a drill guide so you're able to drill straight into the wood. We'll put two dowels into each corner join. Glue the end of the dowel and hammer in with a rubber mallet. You can use a flush-cut saw to trim off the excess dowel after they have dried.

glue and stack them on top of each other to make the bulk of the speaker stand.

Let everything dry for 24 hours.
