I don't know if this is common among men, or if I have a weird sample group, but both my husband and my grandfather like to have their pants out and ready to go at a moment's notice. My grandfather has always hung his slacks on a dining room chair and my husband keeps his pants on a chest by his bedside. I don't know why they have an aversion to drawers, but I've stopped putting them away as they always end up back on that chest.

So recently, my husband asked me to build him a pant rack to hang his aforementioned pants and eliminate the small pile on the chest.
