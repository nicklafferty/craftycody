I don't know if this is common among men, or if I have a weird sample group, but both my husband and my grandfather like to have their pants out and ready to go at a moment's notice. My grandfather has always hung his slacks on a dining room chair and my husband keeps his pants on a chest by his bedside. I don't know why they have an aversion to drawers, but I've stopped putting them away as they always end up back on that chest.

So recently, my husband asked me to build him a pant rack to hang his aforementioned pants and eliminate the small pile on the chest. Okay, I thought, I can make something simple and I do like making things. I also really like things on the walls, so I guess pants are as good as anything.

I made this entire project with scraps, so dig around in your wood bins and see what you have laying around. I was lucky enough to have a long, thin board and thick dowel rods in my scrap pile. The rest is a saw, drill, screws, glue, and stain. I build this in an afternoon, so it should be a quick project as well.

## Supplies:

 1. 1x6 board
 2. 1.25" dowels
 3. Miter saw
 4. Drill
 5. 7/64" drill bit
 6. 1.25" screws #8
 7. Sawtooth hangers x2
 8. Wood glue
 9. Painters tape (optional)
10. Stain and/or paint
11. Shop rags
12. Safety glasses, earmuffs, and gloves

## How-to:

Okay, this will be short and sweet.

Cut your 1x6 to 32 inches. The dowels I cut into 4-inch pegs then cut one end at a 30-degree angle.
