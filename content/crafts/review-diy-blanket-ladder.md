First, here's the [link to Angela Marie Made's tutorial for a DIY blanket ladder](https://angelamariemade.com/easy-diy-blanket-ladder/) you can make yourself in an afternoon. I don't think wood is as cheap as it was when this was written, but it's still an incredibly affordable option if you're a little bit handy. The tools are simple and there are no complex cuts or expensive equipment needed. The result is a large, functional piece that you can paint or stain to go with any decor.
