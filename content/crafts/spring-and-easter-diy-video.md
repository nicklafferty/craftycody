The newest crafting video is live! I really love this one. Follow along and make an easy bear chalkboard sign, a Pokemon-inspired garland, and (my favorite) a woodsy, rabbit wreath perfect for Spring or Easter – or both! I plan to have mine up all year I’m so proud of it. It’s my second foray into wreath making which just shows all you need is an idea and a LOT of hot glue!

I got the idea of the sign from Hobby Lobby and being a true maker, figured I could just make it versus spending the $20 and buying it. The same is true for the slightly Pokemon-esque garland. Dollar Tree had a kit where you could glue together sheep pieces and make your own. Of course, it was only a dollar, but I already had felt at home (plus the ribbon and twine) so why not use what I have already? When you see stuff like that in stores, think back to your stash and remember what you have. There is no sense in adding to the clutter! Lord knows it’s tempting to buy new shinys though. Will power!

The rabbit wreath is one of my favorite things I’ve ever made. All supplies came from Walmart and Dollar Tree and I would expect to see something similar retail from $25-$40 depending on the store. What’s nice is if your Dollar Tree has a decent floral section you can really do this project on the cheap.

I hope you enjoy the video and expect more to come!
