First up, I'm not going to make chairs. No way. I will, however, be making a matching bench and that's one side of the table settled at least.

I have been hunting for a dining table for what feels like years now. Actually, eons. I've found several that I really liked, but then I add up the total with seating and it's absolutely ridiculous. And, to be frank, it's the chairs that kill me. Cool, comfortable, dining chairs are about $150 _each_ minimum. I'm not talking about anything handmade either- it's all mass-produced crap. A set is as much as some tables and I just can't do it. I'm too cheap.
