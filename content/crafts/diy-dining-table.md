First up, I'm not going to make chairs. No way. I will, however, be making a matching bench and that's one side of seating settled at least.

I have been hunting for a dining table for what feels like years now. Actually, eons. I've found several that I really liked, but then I add up the total with seating and it's absolutely ridiculous. And, to be frank, it's the chairs that kill me. Cool, comfortable, dining chairs are about $150 _each_ minimum. I'm not talking about anything handmade either- it's all mass-produced crap. A set is as much as some tables and I just can't do it. I'm too cheap.

So, I'm going to do what I always do and build it for less. I've never made anything this large before so why not start with one of the centerpieces of the home and something everyone will see as soon as they walk in? No problem, right? Right.

The start of any project begins with inspiration. I'm a creative person, but not so creative that I can come up with fantastic, executable designs- they usually don't fall into both categories. I like to look up ideas of things that are known to work and then make them to suit my tastes and/or abilities.

That being said, today's inspiration is [IKEA's MÖRBYLÅNGA dining table](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/moerbylanga-table-oak-veneer-brown-stained-20293766/). It's the right amount of style and thickness that I like. I wanted to stay away from full farmhouse and I believe this table does a good job of being style-neutral, but interesting enough.
