{{< youtube id_here_please >}}

The only saw I ever wanted was a jigsaw. They're maneuverable and, with some effort, can cut a straight line. Their versatility and portability make them an attractive first saw for any handywoman thinking about building something. You are limited on thicker pieces of wood where a miter saw would shine, but if you don't mind making a couple of extra cuts then you're all good.

My birthday rolled around and my parents asked me what I would like. I was in a new phase of building things but really needed a power saw. I asked for the Dewalt cordless jigsaw. Lowe's even had a bundle deal where you got a drill, impact driver, multi-tool, and got to pick a free tool as a bonus. My free tool was the jigsaw.

## Features

Let's start from the top and work our way down.

The handle is very comfortable and places your hand a safe distance away from the blade. The speed dial is in a convenient spot to be easily rotated by your thumb for quick speed adjustments.

The blade release latch and finger guard are at the front of the jigsaw. Pulling the release latch out is how you load and unload the blade.

The orbital action lever is in the middle of the tool. Its horizontal position indicates it will make straight cuts and if you turn it counter-clockwise then it will increase the blade's elliptical motion. Each level will result in faster, more aggressive cutting. I typically always leave the orbital action off as it creates a rough, splintery cut with wood, but you can use it for fast, straight cuts if you want. Do not use the orbital action with metal.

At the bottom of the tool is the shoe and the shoe bevel lever is at the end. You can pitch the jigsaw between 0-45 degrees to make beveled cuts. Move the shoe into its unlocked position and turn the lever outward to adjust the angle. Then, lock it into place and return the lever to its locked position as well.

## Performance

So, does it cut? The short answer is yes. Very well.

However, jigsaws are not meant to cut perfectly straight, but I came up with a trick (which I'm sure many others before have done). I clamp a piece of scrap wood to the board I'm cutting and make sure it's level. I use this as a guide for the jigsaw. I cut right up against that scrap piece and can usually get a pretty straight cut.

What about metal?

I don't think many of us need to cut too much metal, but this little guy can do it. I had to cut a metal (aluminum, maybe?) curtain rod down so that it would fit into my trash bin. It took a little doing because of the awkward shape, but it cut through enough to where I could snap it the rest of the way. This saw shouldn't have any problems with flat sheet metal and has saw blades recommended for those jobs.

## Value/Quality

It's heavy-duty without being super heavy and is about [$200 at Lowe's ](https://www.lowes.com/pd/DEWALT-XR-20-Volt-Max-Brushless-Variable-Speed-Keyless-Cordless-Jigsaw-Battery-Not-Included/1000601417?cm_mmc=shp-_-c-_-prd-_-tol-_-google-_-lia-_-129-_-cordlessdrillsandcombokits-_-1000601417-_-0&placeholder=null&ds_rl=1286981&gclid=Cj0KCQjw4ImEBhDFARIsAGOTMj_tCSmIM5BKOMsEk7x1f1Z3N3o3-keCosg6BEI8D9k9MOwth-XaKQoaAk9iEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds)at any given time. You can find it for less on other sites and there are frequent sales throughout the year. As I said, I got mine in a bundle of 4 tools, batteries, and a bag for $200. That was in November so I guarantee it was part of their Christmas sales. This is a great time to grab tools.

I've found myself buying mostly Dewalt branded tools. This started as an exercise of convenience since they're one of the main brands Lowe's sells and that's the biggest home improvement store in my town. However, they have all been working well and I've started feeling a weird loyalty to the brand. So far, nothing has given me trouble and I do several DIY projects a week with most of my tools. Personally, I don't think you can go wrong with Dewalt. I should add that this post is in no way sponsored by them. Maybe one day though.

## Safety Tips

The first thing to always keep in mind when working with power tools is **safety** and safety is enforced with repetition. I always wear gloves, safety glasses, and earmuffs when using tools.

What I always do when putting my jigsaw away is make sure the safety lock is on and I turn the speed dial down to 1. Then, when I know the trigger is locked, I pull the battery out and set it aside. I also pull the trigger to make sure there is no "juice" in the tool and then lock it again. Last, I take the saw blade out and store it away in a small case. Be careful as the blade may be hot after use so give it a few minutes to cool down.

When setting up the jigsaw, I go in reverse order. I make sure the trigger is locked and the speed is set to 1. I load the blade I'm using that day. Last, I pop the battery in.

## Summary

I'm incredibly happy with this little saw. It's been invaluable to me and I still use this for its portability and quickness. It's an affordable first saw for any hobbyist and has a multitude of uses that something like a circular saw might not.
