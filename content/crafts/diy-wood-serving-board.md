Whew, it has been a minute!

I got busy with my day job and other pet projects i.e. designing templates for my husband and I's [Notion business](https://nicklafferty.gumroad.com/).

But now that the weather has finally cooled down, it's time to get back out in the shop and build stuff.

We recently went on an excursion to IKEA and found [this serving board](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/artistisk-cutting-board-oak-80511083/) that we absolutely loved. It's heavy-duty and has a lovely rustic vibe. However, it's currently $40 which is a little steep considering we were going to use it as decor.

Luckily, I'm fairly crafty and have a big box of scrap wood. I started digging around after we got home and found several pieces that would work to duplicate this thing.

I don't plan to buy anything new for this project, but I will update if I needed to.

Let's get started!

## Supplies:

 1. Scrap wood (I used 1x3s, a 1x5, and 2" balusters. Do **NOT** use pressure-treated wood if this is going to be used around/with food.)
 2. [Miter saw](https://amzn.to/3PuX7Wd)
 3. [Jig saw](https://amzn.to/3W2R39Q)
 4. [Sander](https://amzn.to/3j5T2fg)
 5. [Planer](https://amzn.to/3BE3Kjo)
 6. [Drill](https://amzn.to/3HFH6eo)
 7. [Spade bits](https://amzn.to/3FtBfWR)
 8. [Liquid Nails](https://amzn.to/3HC3MvR)
 9. [Clamps](https://amzn.to/3WDEkL1)
10. Stain/Mineral oil (If you're planning on using this with food in any capacity, be sure to get food-safe varnishes/stains/oils.)
11. Ruler
12. Speed square
13. Safety gear

## How-to:

### Step one:

The first thing we're going to do is pick out wood that will work. I mentioned it above, but do not use pressure-treated lumber if you're planning on using this as a cutting board or putting food on it in any way. That stuff will make you really sick.

I'm planning on using mine as decor and to put plants on top of so I used a piece of pressure-treated wood I had lying around. The rest of the pieces were scrap 1x3s and balusters.

### Step two:

Now, we're going to measure and cut all of our pieces. You can make your serving board as large or as small as you'd like.

The balusters I had were already cut fairly small, so I left those alone until shaping. I'm going to use them as the handle and the 1x3s as the platter.

I'm going for similar dimensions as the IKEA version, so mine is roughly 25 inches long and 10 inches wide at the widest part. I will bite into these measurements when I shape the board later so these numbers account for excess.

When all of your pieces are cut, give them a light sanding.

### Step three:

Time to glue them together. I glued the pieces that will make the platter separate from the balusters that will make the handle since they're different thicknesses. We'll put them together later.

Pick the sides you'd like as the tops, then run a thin bead of Liquid nails down one side of the board and attach the next board to it. Continue until they're all glued together. Use clamps to secure and let dry.
