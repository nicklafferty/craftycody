Whew, it has been a minute!

I got busy with my day job and other pet projects i.e. designing templates for my husband and I's [Notion business](https://nicklafferty.gumroad.com/).

But now that the weather has finally cooled down, it's time to get back out in the shop and build stuff.

We recently went on an excursion to IKEA and found [this serving board](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/artistisk-cutting-board-oak-80511083/) that we absolutely loved. It's heavy-duty and has a lovely rustic vibe. However, it's currently $40 which is a little steep considering we were going to use it as decor.

Luckily, I'm fairly crafty and have a big box of scrap wood. I started digging around after we got home and found several pieces that would work to duplicate this thing.

I don't plan to buy anything new for this project, but I will update if I needed to.

Let's get started!

## Supplies:

 1. Scrap wood (I used 1x3s, a 1x5, and 2" balusters. Do **NOT** use pressure-treated wood if this is going to be used around/with food.)
 2. [Miter saw](https://amzn.to/3X3vHsV)
 3. [Jig saw](https://amzn.to/3W2R39Q)
 4. [Sander](https://amzn.to/3wWcX3X) and [Dremel](https://amzn.to/3jy3aOr)
 5. [Planer](https://amzn.to/3x25TTc)
 6. [Drill](https://amzn.to/3HFH6eo)
 7. [Spade bits](https://amzn.to/3FtBfWR)
 8. [Liquid Nails](https://amzn.to/3HC3MvR)
 9. Wood filler (if needed)
10. [Clamps](https://amzn.to/3WDEkL1)
11. Stain/Mineral oil (If you're planning on using this with food in any capacity, be sure to get food-safe varnishes/stains/oils.)
12. Ruler
13. Speed square
14. Safety gear

## How-to:

### Step one:

The first thing we're going to do is pick out wood that will work. I mentioned it above, but do not use pressure-treated lumber if you're planning on using this as a cutting board or putting food on it in any way. The chemicals used to coat it will seep into your food and can make you really sick.

I'm planning on using mine as decor and to put plants on top of so I used a piece of pressure-treated wood I had lying around. The rest of the pieces were scrap 1x3s and balusters.

### Step two:

Now, we're going to measure and cut all of our pieces. You can make your serving board as large or as small as you'd like.

The balusters I had were already cut fairly small, so I left those alone until shaping. I'm going to use them as the handle and the 1x3s as the platter.

I'm going for similar dimensions as the IKEA version, so mine is roughly 25 inches long and 10 inches wide at the widest part. I will bite into these measurements when I shape the board later so these numbers account for excess.

When all of your pieces are cut, give them a light sanding.

### Step three:

Time to glue them together. I glued the pieces that will make up the platter separate from the balusters that will make the handle since they're different thicknesses. We'll put them together later.

Pick the sides you'd like as the tops, then run a thin bead of Liquid nails down one side of the board and attach the next board to it. Continue until they're all glued together. Use clamps to secure and let dry for about 24 hours.

To be honest, I let the glue dry for a couple of weeks! Not entirely on purpose, but it worked out we went on vacation in the middle of this project. When we got back, all the wood was super secure.

### Step four:

I'm going to use a hand planer to level the wood. Make sure everything is dry or the planer will pop all of your pieces apart. Sand everything smooth when finished.

I was able to clamp my board to the side of my workbench and plane the sides of the board flat.

The balusters I used are thicker than the boards so I ended up needing to plane the handle part quite a bit to make it as flat as the board part. Something to keep in mind when you're choosing wood.

If you haven't already, glue the handle to the platter. I may drill two small holes on either end and use a dowel to secure them together. You'll probably have to do more planing/sanding once it's dry to make sure the serving board is level.

### Step five:

Drill a hole for hanging your serving board on a hook. I used a 1-inch spade bit. I also used a clamp to hold the whole piece together as drilling with spade bits can be jarring for whatever you're working on.

I took a pencil and lightly drew around the handle to create a rough outline. Then, I used my jigsaw to shape the handle. It isn't going to be precise, but we can fix some imperfections with sanding.

This is where I used my Dremel (more precise) and sanded around the hole I drilled into the handle for hooks. I wanted to round off the edges to create a polished look. I also used my actual sander for the edges around the board.

I sanded over the whole thing, front and back, several times. I want this to be as smooth as possible.

When I finished, I used stainable wood filler to fill in the gaps between pieces of wood. This stuff is great because you can sand it after it dries and, as the name suggests, can stain it as well.

### Step six:

Staining/oiling/polishing.
