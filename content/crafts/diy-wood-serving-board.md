Whew, it has been a minute!

I got busy with my day job and other pet projects i.e. designing templates for my husband and I'd [Notion business](https://nicklafferty.gumroad.com/).

But now that the weather has finally cooled down, it's time to get back out in the shop and build stuff.

We recently went on an excursion to IKEA and found [this serving board](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/artistisk-cutting-board-oak-80511083/) that we absolutely loved. It's heavy-duty and has a lovely rustic vibe. However, it's currently $40 which is a little steep considering we were going to use it as decor.

Well, luckily, I'm fairly crafty and have a big box of scrap wood. I started digging around after we got home and found several pieces that would work to duplicate this thing.

I don't plan to buy anything new for this project, but I will update if I needed to.

Let's get started!

## Supplies:

 1. Scrap wood (I had 1x3s, 1x5, and 2" balusters laying around. Do **NOT** use pressure-treated wood if this is going to be used around/with food.)
 2. Miter saw
 3. Jig saw
 4. Sander
 5. Planer
 6. Liquid Nails
 7. Stain/Mineral oil (If you're planning on using this with food in any capacity, be sure to get food-safe varnishes/stains/oils.)
 8. Ruler
 9. Speed square
10. Safety gear
