I think I've said this a million times in the last week about the origins of these pendants, but for those in the back who couldn't hear, I got the idea while I was working on my [deck insert](https://craftycody.com/crafts/finishing-our-deck/). I was shaving down some 2x4s and the slices looked like they'd make great pendants, so I got to work.

## Supplies

1. Wood slices
2. Sander
3. Drill
4. [Eye-hooks](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Hillman-Brass-Screw-Eye-Hook/3202443?cm_mmc=shp-_-c-_-prd-_-hdw-_-ggl-_-LIA_HDW_126_Fastening-_-3202443-_-local-_-0-_-0&ds_rl=1286981&gclid=CjwKCAjwrfCRBhAXEiwAnkmKmaLbp98yzHs_Gn6ckDJh94FRPkGYByR3puoIDKQsEFID1UwrLK8TixoCwk4QAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)
5. [Boiled Linseed Oil](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Jasco-32-fl-oz-Slow-to-Dissolve-Linseed-Oil/50298071)
6. [Polycrylic](https://www.minwax.com/wood-products/clear-protective-finishes/interior/minwax-polycrylic-protective-finish)

## How-to

This DIY is going to be short and sweet, which is how I like it.

I sliced a few millimeters thick pieces off of a 2x4 and sanded them down so they were nice and smooth. I also rounded off the corners a bit. Be sure your pieces are thick enough to put an eye-hook in and not split, but not too thick that they're heavy.

I cleaned them up and decided to seal them with boiled linseed oil. I tried stain at first, but it was going on too dark and I don't get to use my bottle of oil too much so it was a good excuse to try it. The oil will help protect the wood and add a nice finish.

Using my tiniest drill bit, I drilled a pilot hole into the tops of the pendants so I could screw in the eye-hooks. The pilot hole helps the hook go in as well as prevents splitting.

When the oil was dry, I dipped the pendants into polycrylic and used a foam brush to wipe off excess. After the first coat is dry, I sanded them off with 220-grit sandpaper and applied another coat. You'll want to repeat this process for however many coats you decide to do, but I settled on two (I think three would be better though).
