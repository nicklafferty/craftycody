This is going to be a little bit different post than my usual craftiness. It may also contain affiliate links from Amazon.

One night, I was hit with inspiration and began to scour [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/codyscraftcorner) looking for the perfect athleisure look. I wanted leggings, crop tops, sweaters, shrug, sports bras, sneakers..._I wanted it all_.

It all started with [Blade Runner 2049](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1856101/). Joi is one of my favorite characters. She's absolutely adorable and if household holograms were a thing, I would want one of her too. One of her outfits is what sparked this whole journey.

An off-the-shoulder black top with a black sports bra underneath. So. Cute.

However, I don't look like Ana de Armas so I had to find some items that worked for me. You will too and that's okay. It's all about experimentation and finding what you feel great in.

It took me a minute to figure out what I looked okay in. I, like a lot of women, have body issues and I feel like my weight fluctuates all over the place. Finding what you feel good in is so important, so I took some time to find thoughtful pieces that would work well together and I could mix and match. 

We're going to run through some questions that may help you find your style.

#### What is athleisure?

Athleisure is a portmanteau of athletic and leisurewear. It's an everyday casual look that you can take to the gym, shopping, school, and sometimes even work. It's also great for traveling.

We've come a long way from the tracksuits of the 80s and sweatpants of the 90s. Today's athleisure is comfortable _and_ stylish making frumpiness a thing of the past. No longer are we bound to jeans and slacks, but instead a form-fitting, practical yoga pant.
