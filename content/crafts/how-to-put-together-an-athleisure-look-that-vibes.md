This is going to be a little bit different post than my usual craftiness. It may also contain affiliate links from Amazon.

One night, I was hit with inspiration and began to scour [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/codyscraftcorner) looking for the perfect athleisure look. I wanted leggings, crop tops, sweaters, shrug, sports bras, sneakers..._I wanted it all_.

It all started with [Blade Runner 2049](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1856101/). Joi is one of my favorite characters. She's absolutely adorable and if household holograms were a thing, I would want one of her too. One of her outfits is what sparked this whole journey.
