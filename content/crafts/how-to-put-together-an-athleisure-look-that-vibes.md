One night, I was hit with inspiration and began to scour [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/codyscraftcorner) looking for the perfect athleisure look. I wanted leggings, crop tops, sweaters, shrug, sports bras, sneakers..._I wanted it all_.

It all started with [Blade Runner 2049](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/blade_runner_2049). Joi is one of my favorite characters. She's absolutely adorable and if household holograms were a thing, I would want one of her too. One of her outfits is what sparked this whole journey.

An off-the-shoulder black top with a black sports bra underneath. So. Cute.

However, I don't look like Ana de Armas so I had to find some items that worked for me. You will too and that's okay. It's all about experimentation and finding what you feel great wearing.

It took me a minute to figure out what I looked okay in. I, like a lot of women, have body issues and I feel like my weight fluctuates all over the place. Finding what you feel good in is so important, so I took some time to find thoughtful pieces that would work well together and I could mix and match.

We're going to run through some questions that may help you find your style.

## What is athleisure?

Athleisure is a portmanteau of athletic and leisurewear. It's an everyday casual look that you can take to the gym, shopping, school, and sometimes even work. It's also great for traveling.

We've come a long way from the tracksuits of the 80s and sweatpants of the 90s. Today's athleisure is comfortable _and_ stylish making frumpiness a thing of the past. No longer are we bound to jeans and slacks, but instead a form-fitting, practical yoga pant.

## How To Get Started

Listen, I'm not a fashion or clothing person and it can be overwhelming to put together a whole look. I have a hard time finding clothes that look good on me or that I even like. Anything I find on Pinterest won't work for me, I'm obviously not an Instagram model, and honestly? Most people aren't.

So. My advice:

Start with one piece of clothing that you really like and build around it.

Do you have some pants that make your butt look awesome? Top that hugs or shows the right curves? A fly pair of shoes?

Grab whatever it is and start building out from there. You could even use pictures of clothes and drag and drop them into outfits in photoshop.

## What are the essentials?

Ideally, we want to grab solid basics that can intermingle with one another so you can layer as needed. You also want to be able to take everything from summer to winter and back again. This is a lifestyle, people.

I jest, but it's nice to have options all year.

### Bottoms

Elastic waistbands only, please.

#### Yoga Pants

At this point, yoga pants should be a given. I remember when women were just starting to wear leggings by themselves and never thought it would catch on. I thought, "They're so see-through!" or "Where are your pants??" I now almost exclusively wear them. Funny how the world works. I used to only wear the capri style, but now have a few full-length pairs that I love. It's all about variety.

This is a [pair I got from Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07XJNKP19/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=craftycody-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07XJNKP19&linkId=0a9f7f29ec91e1925d7093b501f3b931). They look great but are a touch see-through in the butt so be aware. I also have a pair of [Danskin leggings](https://www.danskin.com/collections/leggings) that I got from Costco. I absolutely love them. They are thick and have pockets for your phone. I've also seen Danskin leggings for sale at Marshalls.

#### Joggers

[Joggers are great]() if you'd like workout pants with a little extra room. I can typically move better in them and there is a much lower chance of someone being able to see your underwear since you have extra material versus tight yoga pants.

#### Shorts

I got my first pair of [bicycle (or yoga) shorts]() a few weeks ago and I love them. They're black, so they match everything, and fit great. I've always had issues of shorts being too tight in the waist but way too baggy on the leg. They would make my legs look like sticks and it was a disaster. These shorts do a great job of hugging my thighs while being comfortable around my middle.

### Tops

Extra points for thumb holes on any long-sleeved option.

There are a lot so let's dive in.

#### Sweaters

My favorite. My life goal is maximum coziness and you get there with sweaters, blankets, and coffee.

No matter what kind of outfit I put together, I usually like either my top or bottoms to be tight while the other is loose. So wearing an oversized sweater with leggings is right up my alley.

#### Hoodies

My second favorite. Really the same as sweaters, but with a hood and front pocket for convenient storage.

I love slimmer hoodies with large hoods, but they're hard to find. Usually have to look in the men's department because women's hoods always make me look like Kenny from South Park.

#### Crop tops

I'm warming up to these as they are getting more and more popular. If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.

Since I'm not a fan of my mid-section, I pair crop tops with high-waisted bottoms when I can. Sometimes I can show off a little ribcage, which I don't mind, but can still hide the parts I don't like.

#### Sports Bras

Same as crop tops with even less fabric. I'd say it's hard to get away with just a sports bra if you're not actively in the middle of working out, but you do you fam.

I like sports bras with interesting details such as a ripped fabric design or just some fun colors. Wearing one under a slightly unzipped jacket is a cute look and a sneaky way to forgo a shirt.

I also let them peak out of most of my shirts since I have several with wider collars or are off the shoulder entirely.

#### T-shirts

I like fitted t-shirts but mostly wear baggy ones admittedly. Doing something simple like rolling up the sleeves helps create a more structured look.

Another plus with baggy tees is you can cut them up to make crop tops or really anything. There are tons of tutorials about transforming old t-shirts into something new. Very cost-effective and good for the environment.

#### Jackets

Yay, outerwear!

The obvious starting place would be track jackets. What you go running in when it's a little chilly out. They often have matching sports bras and/or leggings to complete an outfit.

Windbreakers are in the same family as modern track jackets. They've made their way back from the 80s/90s and are in the mainstream. Good for a workout look while having a little extra room to move in. I have one with Cheetos branding. Very cute.

Then there are puffy coats for when it's hella cold. Pair with sherpa-lined leggings and ear warmers.

#### Vests

I have exactly one vest and included the header because where would athleisure be today without the Han Solo look? Grab your white long sleeve, vest, black leggings, and simple trainers and you're good to go to Starbucks.

### Sets

I'm kind of getting into matching sets. I'm not sure why. Maybe it reminds me of wearing Garanimals as a kid.

I have two sets right now and they're both green (big surprise). One is a jacket and shorts set and the other is more loungewear, but I think I could get away with wearing it out.

What's nice about sets is that the outfit is already made and you can also use them in other outfits as well.

### Shoes

Shoes are usually where I start because they're my favorite. I love unusual-looking sneakers with vibrant colors. You can express yourself so fully with an awesome pair of kicks.

My go-to pairs right now are the[ Lebron 18 'Los Angeles By Night'](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08NH7ZR1X/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=craftycody-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B08NH7ZR1X&linkId=5ebc165f52944ee87dc6d9464088d7b3), these [Asics Noosa Tri 13s in Hot Pink/Sour Yuzu](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08VHB3Y7D/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=craftycody-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B08VHB3Y7D&linkId=a951a554399ca9796b0958e0578b89e6), and the [Puma Sky basketball shoe](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08D9T4ZJ4/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=craftycody-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B08D9T4ZJ4&linkId=b7d3fb96b391084c9e1c10550b9a37be).

This will sound silly, but my dream pair right now are the [Adidas Superstars](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0851HTXLF/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=craftycody-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B0851HTXLF&linkId=dec2844c21435bbf130875a443dffda2) in white with black stripes. I think they're so classic, simple, and versatile that I would love a pair for every day. They also are fairly affordable brand new and go on sale a lot. They come in about 1000 cute color combinations so you're sure to find something you like. It's a good place to start if you're leary about going as nutty as I did.

### Accessories

I typically roll with a more muted outfit and use shoes/accessories to add flavor. It's time to _really_ express yourself now.

It seems like leg warmers are making a resurgence and I am here for it. I used to buy all kinds of huge socks and leg warmers but felt a little weird wearing them in public. I never got any weird looks (that I noticed anyway), but I never saw anyone else wearing them. UNTIL NOW. Apparently, [TikTok]() is pushing the thigh-high leg warmer agenda and I just [bought a pair on Amazon](). Quick review- soft, warm, and they stay in place.

My only advice for [sunglasses](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07CH1FVPQ/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=craftycody-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07CH1FVPQ&linkId=c70bf4b44d2c5e11e72a076313096448) is to go crazy.

Hats are a good accessory for the athleisure look. Baseball caps and beanies work well with the aesthetic. If you're a crocheter like me you can make your own hats to match outfits and to save money.

## What brands to buy?

Let's be real- athletic clothing is sold just about everywhere. If you're environmentally conscious then I suggest going thrifting and buying secondhand clothes. With how popular the style is, you're sure to find deals at Goodwill, Uptown Cheapskate, or Plato's Closet. Those are the stores around me and I can usually find something I like at a good price.

Marshalls and Ross are great secondary options if you don't have a thrift store close by. I've been shopping at Ross for years and have always been able to find good deals on all sorts of things, athletic wear included. Where I live, we have a Marshalls next door to a Ross so it's a fun little shopping trip. I've found better deals at Ross, but Marshalls has more name brands albeit at a slightly higher price.

I don't often shop at name-brand stores because they're expensive. I get targeted ads for lululemon and Fabletics, neither of which I've tried. We do have a large outlet mall with a lululemon store that I've been meaning to go to. Maybe I'll report back on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/codyscraftcorner/) if I go.

The big box stores I frequent are Target and Walmart. Both have extensive athletic wear departments. Walmart is obviously much more affordable, but Target often has sales online that they will price match in store. I also think Target has cuter clothes overall.

Last, but not least, is Amazon. If you can't find something you like in the real world, chances are it's online at the biggest retailer on the planet. The trouble with buying online is you don't really know what you're getting or if it'll even look good. I stick to highly reviewed items with lots of photos and/or things that come in only one size like leg warmers.

## Final thoughts

I love the athleisure look and I hope it stays around for a while. Growing up, I hated wearing jeans and always opted for sweatpants because you could play more easily. Jeans were so constricting! So athleisure was a pretty natural fashion evolution for me.

As with anything in life, all the decisions are up to you and what you like. I hope this blog has given you some ideas on where to begin.
