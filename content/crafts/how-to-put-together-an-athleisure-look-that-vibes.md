This is going to be a little bit different post than my usual craftiness. It may also contain affiliate links from Amazon.

One night, I was hit with inspiration and began to scour [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/codyscraftcorner) looking for the perfect athleisure look. I wanted leggings, crop tops, sweaters, shrug, sports bras, sneakers..._I wanted it all_.

It all started with [Blade Runner 2049](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/blade_runner_2049). Joi is one of my favorite characters. She's absolutely adorable and if household holograms were a thing, I would want one of her too. One of her outfits is what sparked this whole journey.

An off-the-shoulder black top with a black sports bra underneath. So. Cute.

However, I don't look like Ana de Armas so I had to find some items that worked for me. You will too and that's okay. It's all about experimentation and finding what you feel great in.

It took me a minute to figure out what I looked okay in. I, like a lot of women, have body issues and I feel like my weight fluctuates all over the place. Finding what you feel good in is so important, so I took some time to find thoughtful pieces that would work well together and I could mix and match.

We're going to run through some questions that may help you find your style.

## What is athleisure?

Athleisure is a portmanteau of athletic and leisurewear. It's an everyday casual look that you can take to the gym, shopping, school, and sometimes even work. It's also great for traveling.

We've come a long way from the tracksuits of the 80s and sweatpants of the 90s. Today's athleisure is comfortable _and_ stylish making frumpiness a thing of the past. No longer are we bound to jeans and slacks, but instead a form-fitting, practical yoga pant.

## How To Get Started

Listen, I'm not a fashion or clothing person and it can be overwhelming to put together a whole look. I have a hard time finding clothes that look good on me or that I even like. Anything I find on Pinterest won't work for me, I'm obviously not an Instagram model, and honestly? Most people aren't.

So. My advice:

Start with one piece of clothing that you really like and build around it.

Do you have some pants that make your butt look awesome? Top that hugs or shows the right curves? A fly pair of shoes?

Grab whatever it is and start building out from there. You could even use pictures of clothes and drag and drop them into outfits in photoshop.

## What are the essentials?

Ideally, we want to grab solid basics that can intermingle with one another so you can layer as needed. You also want to be able to take everything from summer to winter and back again. This is a lifestyle, people.

I jest, but it's nice to have options all year.

### Bottoms

#### Yoga Pants

At this point, yoga pants should be a given. I remember when women were just starting to wear leggings by themselves and never thought it would catch on. I thought, "They're so see-through!" or "Where are your pants??" I now almost exclusively wear them. Funny how the world works. I used to only wear the capri style, but now have a few full-length pairs that I love. It's all about variety.

#### Joggers

Joggers are great if you'd like workout pants with a little extra room. I can typically move better in them and there is a much lower chance of someone being able to see your underwear since you have extra material versus tight yoga pants.

#### Shorts

I got my first pair of bicycle (or yoga) shorts a few weeks ago and I love them. They're black, so they match everything, and fit great. I've always had issues of shorts being too tight in the waist but way too baggy on the leg. They would make my legs look like sticks and it was a disaster. These shorts do a great job of hugging my thighs while being comfortable around my middle.

### Tops

Extra points for thumb holes on any long-sleeved option.

There are a lot so let's dive in.

#### Sweaters

My favorite. My life goal is maximum coziness and you get there with sweaters, blankets, and coffee.

No matter what kind of outfit I put together, I usually like either my top or bottoms to be tight while the other is loose. So wearing an oversized sweater with leggings is right up my alley.

#### Hoodies

My second favorite. Really the same as sweaters, but with a hood and front pocket for convenient storage.

I love slimmer hoodies with large hoods, but they're hard to find. Usually have to look in the men's department because women's hoods always make me look like Kenny from South Park.

#### Crop tops

I'm warming up to these as they are getting more and more popular. If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.

Since I'm not a fan of my mid-section, I pair crop tops with high-waisted bottoms when I can. Sometimes I can show off a little ribcage, which I don't mind, but can still hide the parts I don't like.

#### Sports Bras

Same as crop tops with even less fabric. I'd say it's hard to get away with just a sports bra if you're not actively in the middle of working out, but you do you fam.

I like sports bras with interesting details such as a ripped fabric design or just some fun colors. Wearing one under a slightly unzipped jacket is a cute look and a sneaky way to forgo a shirt.

I also let them peak out of most of my shirts since I have several with wider collars or are off the shoulder entirely.

#### T-shirts

I like fitted t-shirts but mostly wear baggy ones admittedly. Doing something simple like rolling up the sleeves helps create a more structured look.

Another plus with baggy tees is you can cut them up to make crop tops or really anything. There are tons of tutorials about transforming old t-shirts into something new. Very cost-effective and good for the environment.

#### Jackets

Yay, outerwear! 

#### Vests

### Shoes

Shoes are usually where I start because they're my favorite. I love unusual-looking sneakers with vibrant colors. You can express yourself so fully with an awesome pair of kicks.

My go-to pairs right now are the [Lebron 18 'Los Angeles By Night'](https://www.goat.com/sneakers/lebron-18-db8148-600?utm_source=google_int&utm_medium=google_shopping_int&utm_campaign=14323870519_134709671228&utm_content=540105504230_&utm_term=194497786315&gclid=CjwKCAiA3L6PBhBvEiwAINlJ9HRGkxbSBje_DiSm0Vvn9QpltUMEwYSN23UHOrKNj8BqliOd0mzG3BoCPSkQAvD_BwE), these[ Asics Noosa Tri 13s in Hot Pink/Sour Yuzu](https://www.asics.com/us/en-us/noosa-tri-13/p/ANA_1012B010-700.html?width=Standard), and the [Puma Sky basketball shoe](https://www.amazon.com/PUMA-Modern-Easter-Basketball-Sneakers/dp/B08HDPMB8X).

This will sound silly, but my dream pair right now are the [Adidas Superstars](https://www.adidas.com/us/superstar-shoes/FV3284.html) in white with black stripes. I think they're classic, simple, and versatile that I would love a pair for every day. They also are fairly affordable brand new and go on sale a lot. They come in about 1000 cute color combinations so you're sure to find something you like. It's a good place to start if you're leary about going as nutty as I did.

### Accessories

Sunglasses, hoop earrings, and baseball hats.
