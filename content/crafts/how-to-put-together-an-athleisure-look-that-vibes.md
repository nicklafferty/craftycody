This is going to be a little bit different post than my usual craftiness. It may also contain affiliate links from Amazon.

One night, I was hit with inspiration and began to scour [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/codyscraftcorner) looking for the perfect athleisure look. I wanted leggings, crop tops, sweaters, shrug, sports bras, sneakers..._I wanted it all_.

It all started with [Blade Runner 2049](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/blade_runner_2049). Joi is one of my favorite characters. She's absolutely adorable and if household holograms were a thing, I would want one of her too. One of her outfits is what sparked this whole journey.

An off-the-shoulder black top with a black sports bra underneath. So. Cute.

However, I don't look like Ana de Armas so I had to find some items that worked for me. You will too and that's okay. It's all about experimentation and finding what you feel great in.

It took me a minute to figure out what I looked okay in. I, like a lot of women, have body issues and I feel like my weight fluctuates all over the place. Finding what you feel good in is so important, so I took some time to find thoughtful pieces that would work well together and I could mix and match.

We're going to run through some questions that may help you find your style.

## What is athleisure?

Athleisure is a portmanteau of athletic and leisurewear. It's an everyday casual look that you can take to the gym, shopping, school, and sometimes even work. It's also great for traveling.

We've come a long way from the tracksuits of the 80s and sweatpants of the 90s. Today's athleisure is comfortable _and_ stylish making frumpiness a thing of the past. No longer are we bound to jeans and slacks, but instead a form-fitting, practical yoga pant.

## How To Get Started

Listen, I'm not a fashion or clothing person and it can be overwhelming to put together a whole look. I have a hard time finding clothes that look good on me or that I even like. Anything I find on Pinterest won't work for me, I'm obviously not an Instagram model, and honestly? Most people aren't.

So. My advice:

Start with one piece of clothing that you really like and build around it.

Do you have some pants that make your butt look awesome? Top that hugs or shows the right curves? A fly pair of shoes?

Grab whatever it is and start building out from there. You could even use pictures of clothes and drag and drop them into outfits in photoshop.

## What are the essentials?

Ideally, we want to grab solid basics that can intermingle with one another so you can layer as needed.

### Bottoms

At this point, yoga pants should be a given. I remember when women were just starting to wear leggings by themselves and never thought it would catch on. I thought, "They're so see-through!" or "Where are your pants??" I now almost exclusively wear them. Funny how the world works.

joggers

bicycle or yoga shorts

### Tops

cozy, soft,

long sleeves

### Shoes

Shoes are usually where I start because they're my favorite. I love unusual-looking sneakers with vibrant colors. You can express yourself so fully with an awesome pair of kicks.

My go-to pairs right now are the [Lebron 18 'Los Angeles By Night'](https://www.goat.com/sneakers/lebron-18-db8148-600?utm_source=google_int&utm_medium=google_shopping_int&utm_campaign=14323870519_134709671228&utm_content=540105504230_&utm_term=194497786315&gclid=CjwKCAiA3L6PBhBvEiwAINlJ9HRGkxbSBje_DiSm0Vvn9QpltUMEwYSN23UHOrKNj8BqliOd0mzG3BoCPSkQAvD_BwE), these[ Asics Noosa Tri 13s in Hot Pink/Sour Yuzu](https://www.asics.com/us/en-us/noosa-tri-13/p/ANA_1012B010-700.html?width=Standard), and the [Puma Sky basketball shoe](https://www.amazon.com/PUMA-Modern-Easter-Basketball-Sneakers/dp/B08HDPMB8X).

This will sound silly, but my dream pair right now are the [Adidas Superstars](https://www.adidas.com/us/superstar-shoes/FV3284.html) in white with black stripes. I think they're classic, simple, and versatile that I would love a pair for every day. They also are fairly affordable brand new and go on sale a lot. They come in about 1000 cute color combinations so you're sure to find something you like. It's a good place to start if you're leary about going as nutty as I did.

### Sweaters

hoodies

cropped sweaters

full-zip jackets

vests (han solo look)

## What brands to buy?

lululemon, amazon, Walmart, target. thrifting
