The other day, someone on [r/crochet](https://www.reddit.com/r/crochet) posted a video of this [amazing, new yarn holder](https://www.woolwarehouse.co.uk/accessories/the-wool-jeanie). It's called the Wool Jeanie and it's amazing. It puts yarn bowls to shame.

However, it's currently out of stock.

So, as always, I took out my notebook and drew out the basic design then began figuring out how I could make it myself for less. I think I came up with a pretty good idea!

The twirling motion was the toughest part. I've never made anything with moving parts before. I had some options between swivels and hooks and ended up going with a hook similar to what you'd find on a dog leash.

I also went back and forth about how to keep the yarn on the stick. I didn't want to do anything too complex or too expensive so I settled on a thick dowel with a skinnier one used as a pin on the base. That will hold the bottom of the yarn. You can take out the pin and slide the yarn off without running the top hook through the skein.

All-in-all, this project cost me $16 and one trip to Lowe's. Not too bad. Plus I didn't have to pay for shipping.
