The other day, someone on r/crochet posted a video of this [amazing, new yarn holder](https://www.woolwarehouse.co.uk/accessories/the-wool-jeanie). It's called the Wool Jeanie and it's amazing. It puts yarn bowls to shame.

However, it's out of stock.

So, as always, I took out my notebook and drew out the basic design then began figuring out how I could make it myself for less. I think I came up with a pretty good idea!

The twirling motion was the toughest part. I've never made anything with moving parts before. I had some options between swivels and hooks and ended up going with a hook similar to what you'd find on a dog leash.

All-in-all, this project cost me $16 and one trip to Lowe's. Not too bad. Plus I didn't have to pay for shipping.
