The other day, someone on [r/crochet](https://www.reddit.com/r/crochet) posted a video of this [amazing, new yarn holder](https://www.woolwarehouse.co.uk/accessories/the-wool-jeanie). It's called the Wool Jeanie and it's amazing. It puts yarn bowls to shame.

However, it's currently out of stock.

So, as always, I took out my notebook and drew out the basic design then began figuring out how I could make it myself for less. I think I came up with a pretty good idea!

The twirling motion was the toughest part. I've never made anything with moving parts before. I had some options between swivels and hooks and ended up going with a hook similar to what you'd find on a dog leash.

I also went back and forth about how to keep the yarn on the stick. I didn't want to do anything too complex or too expensive so I settled on a thick dowel with a skinnier one used as a pin on the base. That will hold the bottom of the yarn. You can take out the pin and slide the yarn off without running the top hook through the skein.

All-in-all, this project cost me $16 and one trip to Lowe's. Not too bad. Plus I didn't have to pay for shipping.

## Supplies:

1. Dowels - one each of 1-in square, 5/8-in round, and 5/16-in round
2. [Miter saw](https://amzn.to/3BWm1ce)
3. [Flush cut saw](https://amzn.to/3Lu3KGk)
4. [Drill](https://amzn.to/3RSkCch)
5. [5/8in spade bit](https://amzn.to/3UxDxuS)
6. Wood (scrap 2x4 for base)
7. [3/4in cup hook](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Hillman-Steel-Cup-Hook/3036136)
8. [1 5/8in screw eye](https://www.lowes.com/pd/National-Hardware-N100-217-TB2014-Screw-Eyes-in-Zinc-Plated/5000052475) (I got a pack of 2)
9. [3/8 in x 2 3/16in bolt snap](https://www.lowes.com/pd/National-Hardware-N100-307-V3000-3-8-in-x-2-3-16-in-Bolt-Snap-in-Nickel/1002256752)

## How-to:

This is a fairly quick project. I was finished in only a few hours. I used an oak dowel as my smallest since it's going to be used as a pin and consistently removed. Oak dowels should be stronger than regular poplar dowels.

### Cut list

**2x4:  
**14-in (x1)  
This will be the base of your yarn winder. I made my base this long for stability, but feel free to choose whatever length you need. I'm also planning on finding some small weights that I can glue onto the base. Will update as soon as I do.

**Square Dowel, 1in  
**15-in (x1)  
This is the vertical length of the yarn winder.

**Round Dowel, 5/8in  
**7 1/4-in (x1)  
The horizontal arm that will attach through the top of the square dowel.  
10 5/8-in (x1)  
This is the arm that the yarn will be on. I made it long so it will be suitable for different size skeins.

**Round Dowel, 5/16in  
**5-in (x1)  
This is the pin that will hold the bottom of the skein and keep it from falling off while spinning.
