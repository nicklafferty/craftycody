+++
Ever since I added a stencil to our [laundry room door](https://craftycody.com/crafts/update-laundry-door/), I've been wanting to try it on a larger area. I wanted to start in our bedroom and picked out a stencil that I thought would look good. My husband suggested we also add an accent wall in our sunroom, which I thought was a great idea albeit a little surprising.

Our sunroom is pretty empty and could definitely use some kind of pop. We have one solid wall in there (the others are windows, doors, and an entryway) that we could do anything with. It's tough to hang stuff on it because it used to be an exterior wall and right underneath the drywall is brick, which makes nailing difficult. So, we decided to paint it.

I fell in love with this [chinoiserie-style stencil](https://www.cuttingedgestencils.com/aviant-chinoiserie-wall-stencil-mural-panel-asian-design.html). I absolutely love this sort of print. I bought the large thinking I would only be doing our bedroom wall, so it's a little big for the sunroom, but I think it'll still turn out nice.

## Supplies

1. Stencil
2. Paint (I used 'Ivy League' from Valspar)
3. Foam roller
4. Spray adhesive (recommended, but I don't use it)
5. Painter's tape

## Process

This will be very similar to the pocket door I did except I have to move this one around while lining it up for symmetry. A little added difficulty there.

My main advice when stenciling would be to make sure you're using a foam roller or foam brush. They absorb a lot of your paint, but they apply it so thinly and that helps mitigate bleeding. I got plenty of it with this particular stencil anyway because of the super-thin dividing lines, but there would have been tons more if I had used a traditional brush or roller.
