+++
Ever since I added a stencil to our [laundry room door](https://craftycody.com/crafts/update-laundry-door/), I've been wanting to try it on a larger area. I wanted to start in our bedroom and picked out a stencil that I thought would look good. My husband suggested we also add an accent wall in our sunroom, which I thought was a great idea albeit a little surprising.

Our sunroom is pretty empty and could definitely use some kind of pop. We have one solid wall in there (the others are windows, doors, and an entryway) that we could do anything with. It's tough to hang stuff on it because it used to be an exterior wall and right underneath the drywall is brick, which makes nailing difficult.
