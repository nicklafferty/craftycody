I get nervous when mounting anything to the wall. I always feel like it's going to come crashing down in the middle of the night. However, that's literally never happened to me (yet) because I use proper screws and drill into studs.

It doesn't matter because I felt the same when my husband suggested we mount my super-cool, lime green beach cruiser on our living room wall.
