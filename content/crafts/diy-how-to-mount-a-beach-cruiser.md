{{< youtube id_here_please >}}

I get nervous when mounting anything to the wall. I always feel like it's going to come crashing down in the middle of the night. However, that's literally never happened to me (yet) because I always drill into studs.

It doesn't matter though because I felt the same when my husband suggested we mount my super-cool, lime green beach cruiser on our living room wall.

It's a large wall that was previously taken up by acoustic panels and store-bought art pieces. We didn't really know how else to fill it so it became a catch-all of sorts. The acoustic panels did help since our bedroom is right behind the living room and this big wall has the hallway on the other side of it. The space was definitely functional but lacked any kind of personality.

Enter my bike. It was a birthday present from my folks back when I still lived with them. Yikes, that was a long time ago. It's made a couple of moves with us and I just don't use it as much as I should. We keep moving to hilly areas and it's really suited for flat terrain i.e. a boardwalk at a beach.

We've been doing a little spring cleaning and selling unused furniture on OfferUp and my husband wanted me to add the bike to the list. It's been living in the garage and getting in the way of my makeshift workshop. The thing though is that I love this bike. I love how beach cruisers look, I love that it's my favorite color, and I love it because it was a present from my parents. I have a _really_ hard time giving away anything that has the slightest bit of meaning which is why most of my stuff is still at my parent's house.

Imagine my surprise when he suggested we should mount the dang thing onto the wall so we could display it properly. Very exciting.

I searched around online to try and find a mount I liked and nothing was really grabbing me or were way too expensive. I did find a few that were basically pegs in the wall and it clicked. I would use the same shelving brackets we used on our kitchen shelves! They're 8-inch iron pipes that can each hold about 80 pounds. The bike doesn't weigh that much, but it is a lot heavier than normal bikes so I was happy to overcompensate on the weight requirements.

## Supplies:

1. Drill
2. Impact driver
3. Pipe shelf brackets (x2)
4. Screws (x8)
5. Stud finder
6. Bicycle
