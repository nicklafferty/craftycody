{{< youtube id_here_please >}}

It's officially summer here in Texas and, to put it plainly, it sucks. It's been over 100 degrees every day this week and it won't be letting up any time soon.

That said, I can sit inside in the AC, but my tomatoes are stuck outside. Tomatoes like the sun, but our sun is a little too much for them and they get scorched easily. I'm finally going to help them out this year by building a simple plant shade out of PVC pipe.

This is going to be a really fast DIY. Seriously, you're going to spend more time at the store than you are building this thing.

Supplies:

1. 1/2" 5ft long PVC pipe x12
2. 1/2"
