I like how benches look when paired with chairs at a dining room table. I also like not having to buy eight chairs at $150 a pop. Six chairs are fine, thank you. Plus, this bench comes in at under $70.

Benches are also handy for storing and putting on shoes. I plan to put ours by our coat closest when not in use, then pull it up to the table when we have several guests over which will be exactly once a year at Christmas.

While this bench is totally customizable, I am making it to match the [dining table I built](https://craftycody.com/crafts/diy-dining-table-ikea-dupe/) a couple of weeks ago. It'll have the same vibe and will be a simple build. No weird cuts on the miter saw this time! However, keep this in mind when it comes to the measurements. If you're making this for a table you already have, be sure to adjust the length and height as necessary to fit.

## Supplies:

 1. 2x12x8 (x1) (bench)
 2. 2x4x8 (x2) (legs)
 3. 2x4x4 (x1) (spine connecting legs)
 4. Miter saw
 5. Drill
 6. Wood screws (3in and 4in)
 7. Pocket screws (2.5in)
 8. Ruler and speed square
 9. Sander
10. Planer (if needed)
11. Pocket hole jig
12. Clamps
13. Wood glue
14. Stain
15. Polyurethane
16. Safety glasses and earmuffs

## How-to:

I started off by having the employees at Lowe's cut a 5-ft section off of my 2x12. The shortest board they had was 12-ft and I a.) couldn't fit that into my car and b.) it would be difficult to cut at home.

Other than that, this bench is very simple and won't take near as long to complete as the matching table.

The legs are the same basic frame as the table: four 2x4 pieces cut at 45-degrees and screwed together. We're going to cut eight pieces at
