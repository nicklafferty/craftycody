I like how benches look when paired with chairs at a dining room table. I also like not having to buy eight chairs at $150 a pop. Six chairs are fine, thank you.

Benches are also handy for storing and putting on shoes. I plan to put ours by our coat closest when not in use, then pull it up to the table when we have several guests over which will be exactly once a year at Christmas.
