I like how benches look when paired with chairs at a dining room table. I also like not having to buy eight chairs at $150 a pop. Six chairs are fine, thank you.

Benches are also handy for storing and putting on shoes. I plan to put ours by our coat closest when not in use, then pull it up to the table when we have several guests over which will be exactly once a year at Christmas.

While this bench is totally customizable, I am making it to match the [dining table I built](https://craftycody.com/crafts/diy-dining-table-ikea-dupe/) a couple of weeks ago. It'll have the same vibe and will be a simple build. No weird cuts on the miter saw this time! However, keep this in mind when it comes to the measurements. If you're making this for a table you already have, be sure to adjust the length and height as necessary to fit.

Supplies

1. 2x12x8 (x1)
2. 2x4x8 (x2)
3. 2x4x4 (x1)
4. Miter saw
5. Ruler and speed square
6. Sander
7. Planer (if needed)
