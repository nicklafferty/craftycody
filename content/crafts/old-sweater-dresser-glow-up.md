I am dangerously low on furniture to refinish. Luckily, we just bought a house so that’s occupying a lot of time. More on that later.

I found this dresser by the dumpsters at our old apartment. It was a cute, green color, but was pretty DIY all the way around. I’m fairly certain someone built it because it was a little wonky.

We didn’t have an immediate need for it, but it eventually started housing our sweaters and my crochet projects. So. Many. Scarves.

This project really didn’t take much. I didn’t turn it into anything new and really only wanted to give it a facelift. It was going to get a new paint job and new hardware to give it a fresh look.

Like any good crafter these days, I love chalk paint and I really love pink. I found a very sweet blush color and ordered a can as well as some new knobs. As you can see in the photos above, there were a lot of cracks and paint drips all over this thing. I did my best to sand the drips down and make them smooth, but not all the cracks would get filled in. The second from the top drawer nook was broken on the right side – you can kind of tell in the pictures. I glued it together and found some spackle to fill in the gaps since it’s on the front of the piece. When it was dry, I was able to sand it down to make it more flush with the wood then painted over it.

The bottom drawer opening was too small for any of the drawers and I wanted them to be as flush as possible. I sanded the _hell_ out of both the drawer and the opening to finally get it to fit. It _just_ slides in, but it took me forever to get it to that point. I cannot wait to get some more tools!

After all of the sanding, it was time to paint and paint and paint. I knocked off the old knobs, painted the drawers, then refitted the new knobs. The new screws were smaller than the pre-drilled holes so I had to get creative with some homemade washers. The dresser was a little wobbly as well, so I stuck some of the same wood veneer I used as a washer underneath one of the legs. I do not claim to be a professional carpenter, but it works! No more wobble :).

And really, that was about it! The whole project only took a couple of days and I went pretty slow as to draw it out. I don’t have any other furniture I can work on.

I think it looks pretty good!
