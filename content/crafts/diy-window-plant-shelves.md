I, like many people, have too many plants and not enough window sills to put them on. We have a pretty dark house so I feel compelled to put most of my plants in our large, picture window at the front of our house. However, the window sill is only about 5-inches deep and, even though it's long, it filled up quickly. Since I ran out of horizontal space, it was time to get some ideas which lead to spending hours on [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/codyscraftcorner/).

And it paid off!

I found some great ideas on how to utilize the vertical space of my windows without drilling or any complex construction. It's always a fun challenge to try and recreate something I see online and to see how cost-effective I can do it.

This is a quick and relatively inexpensive project. IIRC, the whole thing cost me about $40.
