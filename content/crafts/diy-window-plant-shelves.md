{{< youtube id_here_please >}}

I, like many people, have too many plants and not enough window sills to put them on. We have a pretty dark house so I feel compelled to put most of my plants in our large, picture window at the front of our house. However, the window sill is only about 5-inches deep and, even though it's long, it filled up quickly. Since I ran out of horizontal space, it was time to get some ideas which lead to spending hours on [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/codyscraftcorner/).

And it paid off!

I found some great ideas on how to utilize the vertical space of my windows without drilling or any complex construction. It's always a fun challenge to try and recreate something I see online and to see how cost-effective I can do it.

Basically, they're floating shelves that use tension rods and some clamps to "float". I'm going to be putting two shelves on mine, but you can add as many as you need so long as it's within the weight requirements for the rods. You don't want this thing crashing down in the middle of the night.

This is a quick and relatively inexpensive project. IIRC, the whole thing cost me about $40.

## Supples:

1. 1x4x4 piece of wood cut in half
2. Drill
3. 1 1/4" spade bit
4. Sander
5. Miter saw
6. Tension curtain rods (x2)
7. Clamps
8. Rubber insulation tape
9. Safety gear (earmuffs, glasses, mask, gloves)
