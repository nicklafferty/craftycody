I, like many people, have too many plants and not enough window sills to put them on. We have a pretty dark house so I feel compelled to put most of my plants in our large, picture window at the front of our house. However, the window sill is only about 5-inches deep and, even though it's long, filled up quickly.

Since I ran out of horizontal space, it was time to get some ideas which leads to spending hours on Pinterest.
