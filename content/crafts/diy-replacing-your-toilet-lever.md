Plumbing is scary. What can seem a minor problem can quickly turn into thousands of dollars and a jackhammer breaking up your foundation to access the pipes. I think plumbing is an essential skill for homeowners to learn and, thankfully, there are many Youtube videos on the subject.

However, it's still scary. What if you mess something up? What if you flood your bathroom?

What if...?

Well, that's why we start small, right? Start with easy, cosmetic fixes and move up from there.

I replaced my showerhead several months ago and it hasn't leaked at all so I guess I did a good job. This was purely a cosmetic fix. Our old showerhead what cheap and had lousy water flow- you never felt like you rinsed all the soap off and forget about washing your hair. I bought a new one with a magnetic arm and replaced it in about 5 minutes. It's literally unscrewing the old showerhead and then screwing in the new one.

But I was still proud of it.
