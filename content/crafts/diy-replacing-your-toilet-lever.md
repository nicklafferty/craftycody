Plumbing is scary. What can seem a minor problem can quickly turn into thousands of dollars and a jackhammer breaking up your foundation to access the pipes. I think plumbing is an essential skill for homeowners to learn and, thankfully, there are many Youtube videos on the subject.

However, it's still scary. What if you mess something up? What if you flood your bathroom?

What if...?

Well, that's why we start small, right? Start with easy, cosmetic fixes and move up from there.

I replaced my showerhead several months ago and it hasn't leaked at all so I guess I did a good job. This was purely a cosmetic fix. Our old showerhead what cheap and had lousy water flow- you never felt like you rinsed all the soap off and forget about washing your hair. I bought a new one with a magnetic arm and replaced it in about 5 minutes. It's literally unscrewing the old showerhead and then screwing in the new one.

But I was still proud of it.

Fast forward to a few days ago when my husband broke our toilet lever. I think it was on the outs for a while and he just happened to initiate the final flush. It was just a plastic lever so it was never going to be long for this world anyway, Still, it's annoying. It's one of those things where it quite literally has only one job and it's failing at it.

So, I went to Lowe's and bought a new toilet lever. I wanted to get a metal one with the intention of it lasting for a long, long time. I found one I liked and grabbed it. It promised to be fast and easy, and it delivered thankfully.

I'll walk you through the steps below.
