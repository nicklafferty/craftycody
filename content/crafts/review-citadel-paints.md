+++
Let me start off by saying I am a total beginner when it comes to painting miniatures. I got into the hobby on a whim and bought some minis from a local comic store. I started off by using normal acrylic paints and my cheap, crappy brushes.

I've been wanting to get paints that the pros use after painting several models with some success. I figured there would be some differences between Citadel's paints and basic acrylics and there are, but just not as many as I had thought.

## Price

After a lot of back and forth, I decided to get [this paint and tools set](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-US/40k-Paint-and-Tool-Set-EN-ES-2020) for $45. The reason being that the paints are $7.50 each and shipping was $10 if you spent under $35 and free if you spent over. So you're at almost $20 for _one_ bottle of paint.

That being said, $7.50 is steep for a small container of paint. I don't like paying that and it's difficult for me when the acrylics I get are $0.79 each and you get more paint.

However, I liked the idea of a set because you get to try several types of paints, the cost per paint goes down, and you get a nice paintbrush that truly is ideal for painting minis. I bit the bullet and it arrived fairly quickly.

## Paints

First thoughts are that they are _slightly_ worth the cost. They go on quite opaque on the minis and that's something that bugged me with my acrylics. This includes metallic paints which are great for armor. The colors are very vibrant and rich. I was quite pleased.

I didn't find them so great that I would be getting all the colors I needed for my minis though. I don't feel as bad mixing and watering down my acrylics to get new colors or the transparency I need as I do with the Citadel paints. It really is connected directly to cost and is a definite mental block for me. You could easily spend hundreds on paints and that's even before you get your minis, which can also be really pricey if you're buying everything new.

The main reason I wanted to try these paints is for the "shade" paints. These are super thin paints that magically add tons of detail to your minis by getting in all the crevices that are hard to paint normally. Originally I'd been watering down black paint, and honestly? Kind of what the shade paints are. I've been having trouble getting it only in those crevices whereas all the videos I've watched do one big brush stroke over the model and poof, it looks amazing. That's also the advice given as well, that it's just so easy. I kind of feel dumb, but I'm not getting the same simple results with the shades. I figure this is a practice and technique thing, so I will keep using it and will hopefully get better.

There are some really interesting ones that add different kinds of textures to models. They're called 'technical' paints and can create things like gritty asphalt and blood or slime that normal acrylics cannot. I think I will look into these more to add details to my minis.

## Brush

The brush is worth every penny.

The bristles are glued together and the tip stays pointy even when painting. This thing has made all the difference. I can paint strands of hair and eyes now! The brush feels like it's even more important than the paints.

I've since bought a little set of brushes on Amazon and they are _amazing_. I didn't splurge for expensive, name-brand ones either. The tips have all stayed pointy and they have upped my painting game.

## Final Thoughts

I think a great resource if you want to get into painting minis is eBay. Tons of people are selling the actual figures and you can get big discounts on lots if you're building an army. I've found some listings on discounted paints, but it might be harder to find colors you need for a good price. They're expensive, they just are.

I don't think I'll be buying any more Citadel paints as I can't justify the costs- for now anyway. Perhaps as I dive more into the hobby, I'll start acquiring better paints.
