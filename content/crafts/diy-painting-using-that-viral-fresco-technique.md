I get a lot of craft and DIY-related video recommendations from Instagram and Youtube. Over the last few months, I've gotten an influx of painting videos. I think because they teach you how to paint a thing, but they're also very soothing to watch.

Recently, I've seen more and more people using a fresco technique. I don't know if that's what they call it, but that's what it is. Fresco is paint added to plaster and painted onto a wall essentially making the painting part of the wall. The frescoes in the Sistine Chapel by Michelangelo are some of the most famous.
