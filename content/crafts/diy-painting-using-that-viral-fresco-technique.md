I get a lot of craft and DIY-related video recommendations from Instagram and Youtube. Over the last few months, I've gotten an influx of painting videos. I think because they teach you how to paint a thing, but they're also very soothing to watch.

Recently, I've seen more and more people using a fresco technique. I don't know if that's what they call it, but that's what it is. Fresco is paint added to plaster and painted onto a wall essentially making the painting part of the wall. The frescoes in the Sistine Chapel by Michelangelo are some of the most famous.

I'm not much of a painter, but I thought it was an interesting technique. Really what people are doing is just making plaster blobs on canvas and shaping them a little with a pallet knife. Nothing too complicated, but the end result is a textured, 3D painting that's unique. It's definitely a fun way to add color to a space.

So, this week I decided to try it. There isn't much detail to go into, but I'll share my successes and mistakes so you can have a jumpstart with your art.

## Supplies:

1. Canvas
2. Acrylic paints
3. Pallet knife
4. Spackle or Plaster (I used plaster)
5. Corn starch to thicken plaster

## How-to:

What's nice about this project is that it's fairly inexpensive and doesn't involve sawing anything. I'm trying to keep out of my shop since it's 100+ almost every day. I've set up an impromptu art studio in my sunroom and have been enjoying being inside and learning something new.

I got all of my supplies at Walmart in one fell swoop. I got a pack of five 16x20 canvases for around $15 which is great in case I really messed up. I decided I was going to make art for a wall in my living room and would use three of the canvases to fill the space.
