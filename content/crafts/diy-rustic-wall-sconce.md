{{< youtube id_here_please >}}

I was perusing Pinterest a while ago (as one does) and came across a wooden sconce that I really liked. I can't remember the price, but I remember thinking that I could easily recreate it for less. So I did.

I found some similar ones on Lowe's and Wayfair for around $50-$100, which is an exorbitant amount of money for such a small thing.
