{{< youtube id_here_please >}}

I was perusing Pinterest a while ago (as one does) and came across a wooden sconce that I really liked. I can't remember the price, but I remember thinking that I could easily recreate it for less. So I did.

I found some similar ones on Lowe's and Wayfair for around $50-$100, which is an exorbitant amount of money for such a small thing. You know my mantra is making the things I see for cheap. Let me show you how I did it.

## Supplies

 1. 2x2x8
 2. 2x4x2 (they have the precut ones at Lowe's)
 3. Miter saw
 4. Drill
 5. Drill bits
 6. Torx screws (x4: 4-in)
 7. Clamps
 8. Wood glue
 9. L-brackets (x2)
10. Polyurathane
11. Stain (I used 2 colors)
12. Hangers (the toothy kind)
13. Ruler
14. Speed square
15. Gloves
16. Eyewear
17. Earmuffs
18. Pencil

## Process

Let me start off by saying I had this grand idea to use dowel pins instead of screws for this project. I quickly found out it's quite difficult to drill perfectly straight down without a drill press. After I had put the whole thing together, I realized it wasn't going to work and rolled with my plan B: wood screws
