I was perusing Pinterest a while ago (as one does) and came across a wooden sconce that I really liked. I can't remember the price, but I remember thinking that I could easily recreate it for less. So I did.

I found some similar ones on Lowe's and Wayfair for around $50-$100, which is an exorbitant amount of money for such a small thing. You know my mantra is making the things I see for cheap. Let me show you how I did it.

## Supplies

 1. 2x2x8
 2. 2x4x2 (they have the precut ones at Lowe's)
 3. Miter saw
 4. Drill
 5. Drill bits
 6. Torx screws (4-in)
 7. Clamps
 8. Polyurathane
 9. Stain
10.
