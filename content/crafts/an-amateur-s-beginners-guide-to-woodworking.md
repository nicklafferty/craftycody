I have a lot of hobbies and sort of fell into woodworking after we bought our home. I always wanted to try building things, but since we rented, it didn't make sense to me to buy a lot of tools to make projects I'd have to move later. I also couldn't make any permanent changes to the place we were in.

Until now.

Now I have a whole house I can do what I want to with. Well, not _whatever_ I want, but close to it.

My husband and I are very frugal people and, as such, it's difficult for us to bite the bullet on more expensive, luxury items- like getting a new couch for example. Our couch is in great shape but doesn't match the home's aesthetic in the least. This bothers me much more than my husband and I get tired of what I call our "college chic" decor. I'm not looking to run out and buy the [Cloud from Restoration Hardware](https://rh.com/catalog/category/products.jsp?categoryId=cat6120041), but it would be nice to have something we picked out that wasn't a free hand me down.

To be fair, I do have a similar mindset to my husband. It's difficult to pay a lot of money for something just because it _looks_ better than what you have. I've always had this mentality and it's culminated into my love of crafting. Like I said earlier, I have a lot of hobbies and most of them stem from the idea that I can "make" something just as good as the thing I would have bought.

This leads me back to our "college chic" decor problem. We have a lot of free or cheap furniture we either brought with us when we moved in together or we found soon after. We really haven't bought a lot of furniture, which was fine. We were starting out, not making oodles of money, and just enjoying this new adventure. Fast forward eight years and I'm tired of looking at the same stuff that was in our first apartment.

So, what am I going to do? Run out and buy a $2000 dining set? A $3000 couch? $800 TV stand? For mass-produced junk?

No, of course not.

I'm going to make all of it. For less. And you can too.

## Starter Tools

I was going to make a YouTube series called "Just a Jig" where I make a bunch of stuff primarily using, you guessed it, a jigsaw. The point is you don't need a lot of expensive, specialty tools to get into woodworking.

The essentials for me at the beginning were a [jigsaw](https://www.amazon.com/DEWALT-DCS334B-Brushless-Tool-Only/dp/B07JPFHQKG/ref=sr_1_4_mod_primary_new?crid=1OP8OZBARKV6M&amp;keywords=dewalt+jigsaw&amp;qid=1650489218&amp;sbo=RZvfv%252F%252FHxDF%252BO5021pAnSA%253D%253D&amp;sprefix=dewalt+jigsaw%252Caps%252C107&amp;sr=8-4&_encoding=UTF8&tag=craftycody-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=aa92cbf892e257eeb9fff82eddb0468b&camp=1789&creative=9325) and a [drill](https://www.amazon.com/DEWALT-DCK240C2-Lithium-Driver-Impact/dp/B00IJ0ALYS/ref=sr_1_5?crid=1HJ6Q2HYDAT0G&amp;keywords=dewalt%252Bdrill&amp;qid=1650489329&amp;sprefix=dewalt%252Bdrill%252Caps%252C106&amp;sr=8-5&amp;th=1&_encoding=UTF8&tag=craftycody-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=5ca24bdef1088287203179922d9e79b6&camp=1789&creative=9325).

Having been doing this for about a year, I would say my favorite tool is my [miter saw](https://www.amazon.com/DEWALT-12-Inch-15-Amp-Compound-DWS715/dp/B07P8QTFRC/ref=sr_1_5?crid=Q4A1BPQD5PJX&amp;keywords=dewalt%252Bmiter%252Bsaw&amp;qid=1650489519&amp;sprefix=dewalt%252Bmiter%252Bsaw%252Caps%252C116&amp;sr=8-5&amp;th=1&_encoding=UTF8&tag=craftycody-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=9e879a66d4320d7337c26ab4bffa5b16&camp=1789&creative=9325). The ability to make straight or angled cuts is life-changing and really speeds up the work.

## Skills

The willingness to learn and take safety seriously. There is a plethora of info out there (for free) so take advantage of it.

## What I like to build

## First Project

You've got something from IKEA, we all do, and I can almost guarantee it's one of those cubby shelving units i.e. the kallax. They're cheap, incredibly functional, and come in enough colors to suit most tastes. They're also, however, unmistakable and if you're wanting a more "grown-up" look then you have to glam that thing up.

There are absolutely _tons_ of IKEA hacks out there that you can try and most of them are beginner-friendly. People are wickedly creative so you'll be able to find another use for your kallax. I did! [I built simple cabinet doors](https://craftycody.com/crafts/doors-ikea-kallax/) and attached them to mine. Now all the electronics are hidden and I didn't have to buy a new TV stand from Article.

[I made a simple knife block](https://craftycody.com/crafts/kinfe-block-diy/) with just a jigsaw, wood, and glue that's a great way to get your feet wet.
