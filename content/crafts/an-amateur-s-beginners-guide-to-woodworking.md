I have a lot of hobbies and sort of fell into woodworking after we bought our home. I always wanted to try building things, but since we rented, it didn't make sense to me to buy a lot of tools to make projects I'd have to move later. I also couldn't make any permanent changes to the place we were in.

Until now.

Now I have a whole house I can do what I want to with. Well, not _whatever_ I want, but close to it.

My husband and I are very frugal people and, as such, it's difficult for us to bite the bullet on more expensive, luxury items- like getting a new couch for example. Our couch is in great shape but doesn't match the home's aesthetic in the least. This bothers me much more than my husband and I get tired of what I call our "college chic" decor. I'm not looking to run out and buy the [Cloud from Restoration Hardware](https://rh.com/catalog/category/products.jsp?categoryId=cat6120041), but it would be nice to have something we picked out that wasn't a free hand me down.

To be fair, I do have a similar mindset to my husband. It's difficult to pay a lot of money for something just because it _looks_ better than what you have. I've always had this mentality and it's culminated into my love of crafting. Like I said earlier, I have a lot of hobbies and most of them stem from the idea that I can "make" something just as good as the thing I would have bought.

This leads me back to our "college chic" decor problem. We have a lot of free or cheap furniture we either brought with us when we moved in together or we found soon after. We really haven't bought a lot of furniture, which was fine. We were starting out, not making oodles of money, and just enjoying this new adventure. Fast forward eight years and I'm tired of looking at the same stuff that was in our first apartment.
