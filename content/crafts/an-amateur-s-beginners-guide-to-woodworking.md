I have a lot of hobbies and sort of fell into woodworking after we bought our home. I always wanted to try building things, but since we rented, it didn't make sense to me to buy a lot of tools to make projects I'd have to move later. I also couldn't make any permanent changes to the place we were in.

Until now.

Now I have a whole house I can do what I want to with. Well, not _whatever_ I want, but close to it.

My husband and I are very frugal people and, as such, it's difficult for us to bite the bullet on more expensive, luxury items- like getting a new couch for example. Our couch is in great shape but doesn't match the home's aesthetic in the least. This bothers me much more than my husband and I get tired of what I call our "college chic" decor. I'm not looking to run out and buy the [Cloud from Restoration Hardware](https://rh.com/catalog/category/products.jsp?categoryId=cat6120041), but it would be nice to have something we picked out that wasn't a free hand me down.

To be fair, I do have a similar mindset to my husband. It's difficult to pay a lot of money for something just because it _looks_ better than what you have. I've always had this mentality and it's culminated into my love of crafting. Like I said earlier, I have a lot of hobbies and most of them stem from the idea that I can "make" something just as good as the thing I would have bought.

This leads me back to our "college chic" decor problem. We have a lot of free or cheap furniture we either brought with us when we moved in together or we found soon after. We really haven't bought a lot of furniture, which was fine. We were starting out, not making oodles of money, and just enjoying this new adventure. Fast forward eight years and I'm tired of looking at the same stuff that was in our first apartment.

So, what am I going to do? Run out and buy a $2000 dining set? A $3000 couch? $800 TV stand? For mass-produced junk?

No, of course not.

I'm going to make all of it. For less. And you can too.

## Starter Tools

I was going to make a YouTube series called "Just a Jig" where I make a bunch of stuff primarily using, you guessed it, a jigsaw. The point is you don't need a lot of expensive, specialty tools to get into woodworking.

The essentials for me at the beginning were a [jigsaw](https://www.amazon.com/DEWALT-DCS334B-Brushless-Tool-Only/dp/B07JPFHQKG/ref=sr_1_4_mod_primary_new?crid=1OP8OZBARKV6M&keywords=dewalt+jigsaw&qid=1650489218&sbo=RZvfv%252F%252FHxDF%252BO5021pAnSA%253D%253D&sprefix=dewalt+jigsaw%252Caps%252C107&sr=8-4&_encoding=UTF8&tag=craftycody-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=aa92cbf892e257eeb9fff82eddb0468b&camp=1789&creative=9325) and a [drill](https://www.amazon.com/DEWALT-DCK240C2-Lithium-Driver-Impact/dp/B00IJ0ALYS/ref=sr_1_5?crid=1HJ6Q2HYDAT0G&keywords=dewalt%252Bdrill&qid=1650489329&sprefix=dewalt%252Bdrill%252Caps%252C106&sr=8-5&th=1&_encoding=UTF8&tag=craftycody-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=5ca24bdef1088287203179922d9e79b6&camp=1789&creative=9325).

Having been doing this for about a year, I would say my favorite tool is my [miter saw](https://www.amazon.com/DEWALT-12-Inch-15-Amp-Compound-DWS715/dp/B07P8QTFRC/ref=sr_1_5?crid=Q4A1BPQD5PJX&keywords=dewalt%252Bmiter%252Bsaw&qid=1650489519&sprefix=dewalt%252Bmiter%252Bsaw%252Caps%252C116&sr=8-5&th=1&_encoding=UTF8&tag=craftycody-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=9e879a66d4320d7337c26ab4bffa5b16&camp=1789&creative=9325). The ability to make straight or angled cuts is life-changing and really speeds up the work.

Top Tool List:

1. Drill
2. Impact Driver
3. Jigsaw
4. Miter saw
5. Sander

You'll also notice I'm linking to a lot of Dewalt tools. I'd suggest sticking with a brand and running with it as best you can because you don't want to end up with 15 different batteries that only fit into one or two tools.

## Skills

The willingness to learn and take safety seriously. There is a plethora of info out there (for free) so take advantage of it.

I'm crafty by nature, so that lends itself to whatever hobby I decide to pick up. However, I don't have any formal training in woodworking. I guess I took a shop class in eighth grade, but that was about 20 years ago now.

I look up lots of things on YouTube, it's such an amazing resource. There are also websites that offer classes like [Udemy ](https://www.udemy.com/)and [Skillshare](https://www.skillshare.com/). As I'm getting more confident in my abilities, I've been thinking about taking a more formal class to learn from a professional.

## What I like to build

Dupes of expensive stuff I see online. I like working backward from a finished product and figuring out how to make it myself for less money.

Trying to build something you find is also a good way to get measurements. Like what's a good height for a TV stand? You don't want to be looking up at the ceiling, but not down at the floor either.

## First Project

You've got something from IKEA, we all do, and I can almost guarantee it's one of those cubby shelving units i.e. the kallax. They're cheap, incredibly functional, and come in enough colors to suit most tastes. They're also, however, unmistakable and if you're wanting a more "grown-up" look then you have to glam that thing up.

There are absolutely _tons_ of IKEA hacks out there that you can try and most of them are beginner-friendly. People are wickedly creative so you'll be able to find another use for your kallax. I did! [I built simple cabinet doors](https://craftycody.com/crafts/doors-ikea-kallax/) and attached them to mine. Now all the electronics are hidden and I didn't have to buy a new TV stand from Article.

[I made a simple knife block](https://craftycody.com/crafts/kinfe-block-diy/) with just a jigsaw, wood, and glue that's a great way to get your feet wet. I have a lot of [woodworking plans available on Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/shop/CodysCraftyCo), but I also post them here on my blog. The PDFs for sale consolidate the information better.

Wandering around on the internet is great for inspiration. Maybe you'll find a few cool projects or some tips you can combine to make one, large thing. I just found some ideas to help cut the cost of a chair I'm planning to build.

## Practice makes Confidence

This is so important. As with anything, working more with power tools and familiarizing yourself with them will lead to you building confidence in your skills. I started with [super simple bathroom shelves](https://craftycody.com/crafts/diy-floating-shelves/) a year ago and last week I built us a [dining room table](https://craftycody.com/crafts/diy-dining-table-ikea-dupe/).

I think woodworking can come off as expensive, time-consuming, and, frankly, is a stereotypically male-dominated hobby. I bought a bunch of tools this past Christmas during a sale Lowe's was having. While carrying them out to my car a guy walking into the store smiled and said, "Someone is going to have a good Christmas!" insinuating my husband. I smiled back and said, "Yeah, me!" He wasn't being a jerk, but it does speak to my point.

It can seem unapproachable, but just about anyone can do it. It's about starting with small goals and working your way up. I've had tons of women tell me how scared of power tools they are. I get it! They're sharp, fast, and can take a finger off in an instant. I was really scared of saws before I started, now I'm making all kinds of weirdo cuts with my miter saw.

Fear is the byproduct of ignorance. I think this applies to a lot of facets of life, but we're talking about woodworking today. Watch how-to videos about your tools, read your manuals, learn all the knobs and buttons, and just practice with them. You'll start to feel more confident using them, I promise.

Maybe it starts as Dollar Tree crafts, but then you want to make something more substantial. Well, you're going to have to cut some wood.
