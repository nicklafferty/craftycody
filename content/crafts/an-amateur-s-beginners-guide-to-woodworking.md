I have a lot of hobbies and sort of fell into woodworking after we bought our home. I always wanted to try building things, but since we rented, it didn't make sense to me to buy a lot of tools to make projects I'd have to move later. I also couldn't make any permanent changes to the place we were in.

Until now.

Now I have a whole house I can do what I want to with. Well, not _whatever_ I want, but close to it.

My husband and I are very frugal people and, as such, it's difficult for us to bite the bullet on more expensive, luxury items- like getting a new couch for example. Our couch is in great shape but doesn't match the home's aesthetic in the least. This bothers me much more than my husband and I get tired of what I call our "college chic" decor. I'm not looking to run out and buy the [Cloud from Restoration Hardware](https://rh.com/catalog/category/products.jsp?categoryId=cat6120041), but it would be nice to have something we picked out that wasn't a free hand me down.

To be fair, I do have a similar mindset to my husband. It's difficult to pay a lot of money for something just because it _looks_ better than what you have. I've always had this mentality and it's culminated into my love of crafting. Like I said earlier, I have a lot of hobbies and most of them stem from the idea that I can "make" something just as good as the thing I would have bought.
