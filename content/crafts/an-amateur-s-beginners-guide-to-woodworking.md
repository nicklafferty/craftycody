I have a lot of hobbies and sort of fell into woodworking after we bought our home. I always wanted to try building things, but since we rented, it didn't make sense to me to buy a lot of tools to make projects I'd have to move later. I also couldn't make any permanent changes to the place we were in.

Until now.
