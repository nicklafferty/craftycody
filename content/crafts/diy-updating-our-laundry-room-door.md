Our kitchen is white and grey- basically a blank canvas. I was hesitant to go with white cabinets because I really like color, however, my husband is the opposite which I understand. A lot of people really love neutral pallets...or are scared of color. However, I get the appeal of going with white cabinets in your kitchen. You can pull color in with decor or accents. I realize now that I might get sick of whatever color we painted the cabinets and want to redo them.

We have a pocket door that leads into the laundry room from the kitchen and, guess what, it's also white. Since moving in, my husband has gotten more used to the idea that not everything needs to be some shade of grey. So when he suggested we paint the pocket door a fun color, I jumped at the opportunity.

Then he also threw out that we should put a design on it too. I was over the moon, to say the least.
