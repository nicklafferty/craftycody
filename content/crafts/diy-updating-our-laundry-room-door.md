Our kitchen is white and grey- basically a blank canvas. I was hesitant to go with white cabinets because I really like color, however, my husband is the opposite which I understand. A lot of people really love neutral pallets...or are scared of color. However, I get the appeal of going with white cabinets in your kitchen. You can pull color in with decor or accents. I realize now that I might get sick of whatever color we painted the cabinets and want to redo them.

We have a pocket door that leads into the laundry room from the kitchen and, guess what, it's also white. Since moving in, my husband has gotten more used to the idea that not everything needs to be some shade of grey. So when he suggested we paint the pocket door a fun color, I jumped at the opportunity.

Then he also threw out that we should put a design on it too. I was over the moon, to say the least.

I would paint everything in here some shade of green if I could and this door was no exception. I bought a lovely shade of emerald green from home depot.

The hard part was finding a design we wanted to paint over it. I'm pretty crafty, but I'm not a great painter. I didn't feel like I could freehand some beautiful mural and didn't want it to be too busy either. This led us to start looking into stencils. They're really popular right now and I've seen people use them to refresh all kinds of spaces. One of my favorites is using them on tile versus ripping it all up and laying new stuff.

Anyway, we knew we wanted a simple design and scoured through countless sites trying to find the right one. We finally settled on this [palm frond from Cutting Edge Stencils](https://www.cuttingedgestencils.com/palm-leaf-stencil-tropical-wallpaper-stencils.html). We liked the example picture so much that we decided to do something similar on our door.
