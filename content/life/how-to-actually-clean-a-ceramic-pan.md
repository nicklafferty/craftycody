As you might have guessed, I'm super into DIY and that includes cleaning and restoration techniques. I'm currently trying to restore an old tea kettle and I had a copper pan with a burnt-on mess that refused to come off.

Sidebar, the best way to clean copper pans is salt and vinegar. The salt scrapes off burnt junk without damaging the pan. It was a miracle worker and got that pan looking like new.

I recently bought a pair of ceramic pans to replace our old Teflon ones. I have a pressure cooker that utilizes a ceramic pot inside and am always impressed with how easily it wipes clean no matter what I cook in it. I figured this would be the way to go for day-to-day cooking.

I was right, for the most part. The bigger pan is still in near-mint condition despite being used fairly often, however, the smaller one started losing its non-stick capabilities and food/oil was burning into the pan. I mean it was literally becoming a part of the pan itself. Like, it will be assimilated and resistance is futile kind of bond.
