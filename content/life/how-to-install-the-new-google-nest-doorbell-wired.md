Google just released their updated version of the wired Nest video doorbell and my husband ordered ours on day one. Our current doorbell was definitely at the end of its life having made a couple of moves and just slowing down all around.

Plus it's fun to get a new toy.

However, I'm always the one who has to install these things because I read the instructions.

All-in-all it's a straightforward process and we didn't run into any issues where we needed to call a professional. Let's go through the step-by-step process of replacing your Nest doorbell with the new one and I'll address a couple of issues I encountered that you may face too.

## Supplies:

1. Google Nest Video Doorbell (Wired)
2. Drill
3. Screwdriver
4. Needlenose pliers

## How-to:

**Step 1:** The instructions say that we're going to start by disconnecting our old chime and replacing it with the included one. I wish we could just use the chime we had since it was all hooked up, but I guess they won't talk to each other.

Start by turning off all of the power at the breaker box. We went ahead and flipped just about every switch just to be sure because Lord knows which circuit the chime is connected to. Is it the hallway lights or the hallway bathroom? Both, off as well as the actual doorbell's circuit.

Once the power is off, pop off the chime box cover. Our old Nest chime was hooked up, but the new chime has fewer wires so we had to reattach the white and red wires back onto the chime box. For us, the red goes on the TRANS screw and the white goes on the FRONT screw. It doesn't matter which screw the Nest's chime wires attach to so long as one is on TRANS and the other on FRONT.

**Step 2:** Now let's move on to the actual doorbell. To remove an old Nest video doorbell you need to insert a skinny "key" into the bottom and it pops off. If you've lost that key as I have, then a thumbtack works great. Push the pin into the tiny hole on the bottom of the doorbell and it should pop out. Then wiggle it loose and disconnect the wires. Set aside.
