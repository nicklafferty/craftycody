Google just released their updated version of the wired Nest video doorbell and my husband ordered ours on day one. Our current doorbell was definitely at the end of its life having made a couple of moves and just slowing down all around.

Plus it's fun to get a new toy.

However, I'm always the one who has to install these things because I read the instructions.

All-in-all it's a straightforward process and we didn't run into any issues where we needed to call a professional. Let's go through the step-by-step process of replacing your Nest doorbell with the new one and I'll address a couple of issues I encountered that you may face too.

## Supplies:

1. Google Nest Video Doorbell (Wired)
2. Drill
3. Screwdriver
4. Needlenose pliers

## How-to:

Step 1: The instructions say that we're going to start by disconnecting our old chime and replacing it with the included one. I wish we could just use the chime we had since it was all hooked up, but I guess they won't talk to each other.

Start by turning off all of the power at the breaker box. We went ahead and flipped just about every switch just to be sure because Lord knows which circuit the chime is connected to. Is it the hallway lights or the hallway bathroom? Both, off as well as the actual doorbell's circuit.
