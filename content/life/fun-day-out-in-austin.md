This past weekend my husband and I went on a photography adventure. He recently bought a new drone that takes incredible video and photos. We decided to start out at Zilker Park to get some shots of the city skyline.

He has the [DJI Mavic Mini](https://www.dji.com/mavic-mini).

I love how you can grab the river and city with a drone. Just something you cannot do with a camera alone- which is how I roll of course.

Next, we went over to [Sandy’s](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Sandys-Hamburgers/120669561281714?rf=130496560618456). So delicious. We’re planning on moving out of Austin soon and wanted to take a tour of the places we used to go to all the time when we first came down here. Of course Sandy’s made the list. If you’ve never been or are planning a trip here be sure to go. Or if you go a lot, then go back right now.

We came back home late in the day to relax and enjoy the rest of the weekend. I played some Switch while Nick was actually productive and did some writing/reading. There are Pokemon to catch and I’ll be dammed if I’m going to let them get away.

Even though crafting all day is fun, it’s important to get out and do things. Your stuff will be at home waiting for you when you get back.
