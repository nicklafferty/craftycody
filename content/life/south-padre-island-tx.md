This past week I skipped blogging because I was getting ready for a long-awaited beach vacation.

I've lived in Texas my entire life and had never been to South Padre. It's not too surprising- I wasn't much of a Spring Breaker and it's very far from my hometown in the DFW area, so it never really made sense to go.

I also assumed it was similar enough to Galveston which, bless them, isn't that great of a beach. The gulf is usually pretty brown too. I figured I'd always have to fly to go to decent beaches and that was just the way of it.

Until I started doing some research into South Padre. Since it's so far south, it benefits from the tropical climate of Mexico and, since it's a long island, more closely resembles Miami than it does Galveston.

Fast forward a few months and my husband gets the idea to take his parents on a vacation and lands on South Padre. It's a beach, it's driveable, and we can bring our dog who had never seen the ocean before.

The whole place really took me by surprise. It's hard to get a beat on something without seeing it for yourself, but once you cross the big bridge and get to the island proper, it really does feel like Miami albeit with much less of a party vibe.
