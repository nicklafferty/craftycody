+++
This past week I skipped blogging because I was getting ready for a long-awaited beach vacation.

I've lived in Texas my entire life and had never been to South Padre. It's not too surprising- I wasn't much of a Spring Breaker and it's very far from my hometown in the DFW area, so it never really made sense to go.

I also assumed it was similar enough to Galveston which, bless them, isn't that great of a beach. The gulf is usually pretty brown too. I figured I'd always have to fly to go to decent beaches and that was just the way of it.

Until I started doing some research into South Padre. Since it's so far south, it benefits from the tropical climate of Mexico and, since it's a long island, more closely resembles Miami than it does Galveston.

Fast forward a few months, my husband gets the idea to take his parents on a vacation and lands on South Padre. It's a beach, it's driveable, and we can bring our dog who had never seen the ocean before.

The whole place really took me by surprise. It's hard to get a beat on something without seeing it for yourself, but once you cross the big bridge and get to the island proper, it really does feel like Miami albeit with much less of a party vibe.

The island is filled with high-rise condos and billionaires are currently buying up real estate and renovating it. While that means prices will skyrocket, it's looking terrific and updated.

This is the area where we did all of our vacationing. The part of the island we stayed on was probably only about 10 miles long and maybe a mile wide at the widest. Sometimes while driving you could see the beach out either car window at the same time. It's a really tiny place and would be walkable in cooler months.

I want to run down what we were up to in South Padre to help convince fellow Texans (or anyone!) to make the drive and visit.

## Beach

We [stayed at this VRBO](https://www.vrbo.com/228178ha) that was basically right on the beach! Every morning we could sip our coffee from a bench swing or rocking chair and look out over the ocean- it was incredible. There was also easy beach access directly across the street. Literally only had to walk a few steps and you were in the sand.

The beach itself was so nice. Very clean, with no seaweed anywhere, and it was sparsely populated because I think we went in the offseason which I highly recommend. You can section off your own chunk of the beach and not have anyone around you all day.

And, as I said earlier, the water was so blue!

## Restaurants

### Joe's Oyster Bar

This is a no-frills place in Port Isabel that does seafood right. Our VRBO host had a binder with a _ton_ of recommendations on where to eat and Joe's was a favorite. What was so wild to me about all the seafood restaurants was the prices. It's insanely cheap. I had the Nathan Special. It was only $14 and had a grilled piece of flounder, shrimp, and a crab cake included. That and everything was caught that morning. Definitely some of the best seafood I've had. We also shared a half order of raw oysters which were great as well.

## Check out my outfits

This is all the beach wear I wore on vacation so everything has the seal of approval that it stays on and looks good in the ocean. They're Amazon affiliate links so I'll get a little kickback from your purchase, but there is no added cost to you so shop away!

I wore this every day at the beach. [My swimsuit](https://amzn.to/3BdNN2j) was only $24 when purchased, but it looks like it went back up to $29. Keep checking for sales! You can wear it two different ways and it comes in a ton of color options. I got a size medium in green and it fits great. There is a little ruching around the stomach for some camouflage as well.

[My hat](https://amzn.to/3xpqx0b) is a _touch_ big for my head, but it's still cute and allows me to wear a ponytail or bun while keeping the sun off my face. By big, I mean it covers my ears just a bit but stays put on my head. The adjustable band is velcro and there's an adorable, subtle bow on the back. I ordered beige brown and it was only $15.

I did a lot of research into sunglasses and ultimately went with [this pair of sunnies](https://amzn.to/3Le8Aas) from J+S. I ordered a size large with pink mirror lenses. They look great, are inexpensive, and, most importantly, will protect your eyes.

Men's swim shorts always have convenient pockets, but it seems like women's clothes get left out. I found this [pair of high-waisted shorts](https://amzn.to/3RYUH2f) with a zip-up pocket and usually wear them when I do anything in the water. They're also great for working out because they're lightweight and dry quickly.

This [crop tank](https://amzn.to/3QLe5ia) was another Amazon find a while ago, but I'm constantly wearing it. It's perfect for the gym but comes in so many colors you could wear it every day for different stuff. It hugs you at the bottom so the fabric bunches some to create a unique silhouette that pairs well with tight yoga pants. I got a medium in army green, but would probably go with a small next time.
