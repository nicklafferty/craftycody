This past week I skipped blogging because I was getting ready for a long-awaited beach vacation.

I've lived in Texas my entire life and had never been to South Padre. It's not too surprising- I wasn't much of a Spring Breaker and it's very far from my hometown in the DFW area, so it never really made sense to go.

I also assumed it was similar enough to Galveston which, bless them, isn't that great of a beach. The gulf is usually pretty brown too. I figured I'd always have to fly to go to decent beaches and that was just the way of it.

Until I started doing some research into South Padre. Since it's so far south, it benefits from the tropical climate of Mexico and, since it's a long island, more closely resembles Miami than it does Galveston.

Fast forward a few months, my husband gets the idea to take his parents on a vacation and lands on South Padre. It's a beach, it's driveable, and we can bring our dog who had never seen the ocean before.

The whole place really took me by surprise. It's hard to get a beat on something without seeing it for yourself, but once you cross the big bridge and get to the island proper, it really does feel like Miami albeit with much less of a party vibe.

The island is filled with high-rise condos and billionaires are currently buying up real estate and renovating it. While that means prices will skyrocket, it's looking terrific and updated.

The most surprising thing was that the water was actually blue. Like really, really blue. You don't feel like you're in Texas at all and it's surreal.

This is the area where we did all of our vacationing. The part of the island we stayed on was probably only about 10 miles long and maybe a mile wide at the widest. Sometimes while driving you could see the beach out either car window at the same time. It's a really tiny place and would be walkable in cooler months.

I want to run down what we were up to in South Padre to help convince fellow Texans (or anyone!) to make the drive and visit.

I wore this every day at the beach. [My swimsuit](https://amzn.to/3BdNN2j) was only $24 when purchased, but it looks like it went back up to $29. Keep checking for sales! You can wear it two different ways and it comes in a ton of color options. I got a size medium in green and it fits great. There is a little ruching around the stomach for some camouflage as well.
