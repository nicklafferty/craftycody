This past week I skipped blogging because I was getting ready for a long-awaited beach vacation.

I've lived in Texas my entire life and had never been to South Padre. It's not too surprising- I wasn't much of a Spring Breaker and it's very far from my hometown in the DFW area, so it never really made sense to go.

I also assumed it was similar enough to Galveston which, bless them, isn't that great of a beach. The gulf is usually pretty brown too. I figured I'd always have to fly to go to decent beaches and that was just the way of it.

Until I started doing some research into South Padre. Since it's so far south, it benefits from the tropical climate of Mexico and more closely resembles Miami than it does Galveston.
