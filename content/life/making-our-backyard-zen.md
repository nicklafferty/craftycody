I am not a landscape designer by any stretch of the imagination. I am, however, an avid plant enthusiast and Pinterest lurker. Clearly, I'm qualified to spend a bunch of money and design our backyard with only a vision in my head.

Just kidding, I never spend a bunch of money.

Our backyard is a total blank slate. As was our [front yard](https://craftycody.com/life/front-yard-xeriscape/), but we let it die and had to do something with it lest the neighbors start side-eyeing us. The backyard has several wonderful trees (one of the main reasons I bought the house) and healthy grass, but that's kind of all it had going. It was beautiful, but there was no personal touch to it, and you know how I like that. It's why I bought an old house that needed updating.

We've been here almost 2 years and I've always known that I wanted to do a Japanese-inspired garden back there. Maybe not as elaborate as some of the ones I found on Google, but definitely taking themes from those images and incorporating them into the yard.
