I am not a landscape designer by any stretch of the imagination. I am, however, an avid plant enthusiast and Pinterest lurker. Clearly, I'm qualified to spend a bunch of money and design our backyard with only a vision in my head.

Just kidding, I never spend a bunch of money.

Our backyard was a total blank slate. As was our [front yard](https://craftycody.com/life/front-yard-xeriscape/), but we let it die and had to do something with it lest the neighbors start side-eyeing us. The backyard has several wonderful trees (one of the main reasons I bought the house) and healthy grass, but that's kind of all it had going. It was beautiful, but there was no personal touch to it, and you know how I like that. It's why I bought an old house that needed updating.

We've been here almost 2 years and I've always known that I wanted to do a Japanese-inspired garden back there. Maybe not as elaborate as some of the ones I found on Google, but definitely taking themes from those images and incorporating them into the yard.

So this is what we did.

## Planning

What's unfortunate about landscape design is the time it takes to get the results you want. Many plants take a _long_ time to grow and your garden can feel empty while you're waiting for it to fill out. I know I felt that way when it came to our front yard, but now that most plants are super bushy and full I can finally start seeing the vision come to life.

You have to take all those growth times into account. I'm sure we're all guilty of planting small plants too close together and then they run out of room once they grow up. Really listen to those tags attached to the plants you buy.

Besides growth time, there are plenty of things to keep in mind when making a landscape design. Always check a plant's hardiness zone. We're in zone 8 which means we can plant things rated for zone 8 and down (i.e zone 7, 6, 5, etc.). These zones are your cold hardiness ratings. This means if I get a plant that's rated for zone 10, I need to keep it in a pot and bring it inside when it gets too cold or keep it in a greenhouse otherwise it won't make it.

Soil type also plays a big part in what you can and cannot plant. One thing that's always recommended is getting your soil tested and finding out its pH as well as what kind of chemical makeup you've got going on in there. Some plants can be extremely temperamental when it comes to pH which can lead to making some overly complicated fertilizers.

There are a ton of things to keep in mind when it comes to designing your outdoor space. I'll probably be dedicating an entire blog post to that later. For now, the main thing I wanted to convey what the aesthetic of the space itself. What is the vibe you're going for? As I said earlier, I've been wanting a zen-esque garden to relax in and listen to the rain.

## Drawing

The single best thing you can do is to draw everything out. Is it a pain? Yes. Does it help to have everything to scale? Yes. Can you absolutely drown in math? Yes.

I'm going to let you all in on a secret- I don't draw to scale. If I was a professional, sure I would. But for my own personal projects? No way, no one has time for that.

Regardless, putting it down on paper is step one. You can place plants before digging any holes and draw landscape edging or decor before buying.

If you're going to be buying pebbles as we did, then you'll definitely need to be doing some math which is where a drawing also helps. Writing down all your measurements and where they are is a huge help in keeping everything organized.

Drawing a design plan helps to visualize what you want...or help your partner visualize what you want. Sometimes saying. "I promise it'll look good!" won't be enough to convince them. Trust me, I've tried. 

I am usually right about it, though.
