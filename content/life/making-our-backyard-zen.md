I am not a landscape designer by any stretch of the imagination. I am, however, an avid plant enthusiast and Pinterest lurker. So clearly I'm qualified to spend a bunch of money and design our backyard with only a vision in my head.

Just kidding, I never spend a bunch of money.

Our backyard is a total blank slate. As was our [front yard](https://craftycody.com/life/front-yard-xeriscape/), but we let it die and had to do something with it lest the neighbors start side-eyeing us.
