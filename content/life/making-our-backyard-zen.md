I am not a landscape designer by any stretch of the imagination. I am, however, an avid plant enthusiast and Pinterest lurker. Clearly, I'm qualified to spend a bunch of money and design our backyard with only a vision in my head.

Just kidding, I never spend a bunch of money.

Our backyard was a total blank slate. As was our [front yard](https://craftycody.com/life/front-yard-xeriscape/), but we let it die and had to do something with it lest the neighbors start side-eyeing us. The backyard has several wonderful trees (one of the main reasons I bought the house) and healthy grass, but that's kind of all it had going. It was beautiful, but there was no personal touch to it, and you know how I like that. It's why I bought an old house that needed updating.

We've been here almost 2 years and I've always known that I wanted to do a Japanese-inspired garden back there. Maybe not as elaborate as some of the ones I found on Google, but definitely taking themes from those images and incorporating them into the yard.

## Planning

What's unfortunate about landscape design is the time it takes to get the results you want. Many plants take a _long_ time to grow and your garden can feel empty while you're waiting for it to fill out. I know I felt that way when it came to our front yard, but now that most plants are super bushy and full I can finally start seeing the vision come to life.

You have to take all those growth times into account. I'm sure we're all guilty of planting small plants too close together and then they run out of room once they grow up. Really listen to those tags attached to the plants you buy.
