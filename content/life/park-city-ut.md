Nick's favorite vacations are at the beach, but I love the forest and mountains. I could spend all my time up there in a coat and with a cup of coffee. It's my kind of nature.

This leads me to before Christmas. Nick was lamenting we didn't have any upcoming trips planned while we had a week off in early January.

So we decided to change that.

We don't do a lot of "last minute" trips, but both of us had been talking about trying snowboarding for a while. We've both been skiing separately, but have never taken a mountain vacation together. And what better time to go to the mountains than in the winter?

## Gear

I'll get into the actual trip in a moment but wanted to start off with all the gear we had to get to make this trip possible. There is a _lot_ of stuff we had to buy that can make a trip like this prohibitive and I'm glad we waited so long to try it.

The point of most of this gear is to keep you **warm and dry**. You do not want to wear jeans otherwise you'll be wet and cold all day. I fell a _lot_, but I stayed dry the whole time.

## Park City, UT

We landed on Park City because, well, it's a really popular ski destination and popular places usually have all of their tourist activities down to a science. We wanted a vacation that would be easy to plan since it's something we hadn't done before.
