Nick's favorite vacations are at the beach, but I love the forest and mountains. I could spend all my time up there in a coat and with a cup of coffee. It's my kind of nature.

This leads me to before Christmas. Nick was lamenting we didn't have any upcoming trips planned while we had a week off in early January.

So we decided to change that.

We don't do a lot of "last minute" trips, but both of us had been talking about trying snowboarding for a while. We've both been skiing separately, but have never taken a mountain vacation together. And what better time to go to the mountains than in the winter?

## Gear

I'll get into the actual trip in a moment but wanted to start off with all the gear we had to get to make this trip possible. There is a _lot_ of stuff we had to buy that can make a trip like this prohibitive and I'm glad we waited so long to try it.

The point of most of this gear is to keep you **warm and dry**. You do not want to wear jeans otherwise you'll be wet and cold all day. I fell a _lot_, but I stayed dry the whole time.

I'm going to be upfront, this stuff is expensive. It's because it's specialty equipment and works hard to keep you safe, dry, and warm. Even the cheap stuff is pricey.

### Snowboarding coat

This was my favorite purchase. I don't have any kind of ski jacket because I live in Texas, so being able to find something cute was a lot of fun. I'm definitely a form-over-function person but, again, I needed to find something that would keep me warm and dry.

I did a little light Googling and found [Dope Snow](https://www.dopesnow.com/) which looks like a lifestyle brand run by a bunch of influencers. That being said, most of those brands have the cutest stuff. I checked around on some snowboarding forums and Reddit to see if people actually like their stuff and the consensus was positive.

I decided to bite the bullet and bought the [Adept W](https://www.dopesnow.com/adept-w-snowboard-jacket-women-soft-green) in soft green. And, y'all, it's so cute. I saw a lot of Dope Snow on the mountain so I felt good about buying it.

### Snowboard/ski pants

I found a pair of [North Face ski pants](https://www.rei.com/product/194944/the-north-face-freedom-insulated-snow-pants-womens-short-sizes) on sale at REI so check those sale racks! I think they're cute and they complement my jacket.

### Base layers

I wore a top and bottom base layer. The first day I wore two top layers and got way too hot. It was miserable. The highs hit the 40s if you can believe it and two layers were just too much.

Both my top and bottoms were [Patagonia](https://www.patagonia.com/shop/womens-baselayers).

### Gloves

So gloves are all about preference. We bought these [mittens from REI](https://www.rei.com/product/177846/rei-co-op-guide-insulated-mittens), but I think I'd like something else for next time. I felt like I couldn't grab anything in mittens.

I'm going to look for actual gloves instead of mittens and something that feels more water-resistant.

### Goggles

Again, preference. I found this [cute pink pair on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B8G8SM3R?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1). Pay attention to what kind of lighting each lens is suited for. When we went, it was sunny and these really helped mitigate the reflection off of the snow.

### Balaclava/gaiter

You gotta keep the wind off of your face. I bought [this two-pack of face gaiters](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08M99BJV1?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1) from Amazon and wore the pink one. They were a little thick but did keep my face warm.

### Padded underwear

Buy this. Trust me. This will be the [most expensive underwear](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0059CWT3U?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1&psc=1) you ever buy, but your butt will thank you. My tailbone didn't so much as bruise during our trip because of these.

Be sure to size up your ski pants to make sure these fit underneath. They are super padded.

### Wrist guards

## Rental equipment

We rented the rest of our gear: snowboards, boots, and helmets. I cannot stress enough how important the helmet is. As I said, I fell a bunch, but I only landed on my head once and my helmet saved me from having a really bad day.

We were able to rent our gear inside our hotel so it made pickup and dropoff very easy. There are rental places all over Canyons Village and Park City.

## Park City, UT

We landed on Park City because, well, it's a really popular ski destination and popular places usually have all of their tourist activities down to a science. We wanted a vacation that would be easy to plan since it's something we hadn't done before.
