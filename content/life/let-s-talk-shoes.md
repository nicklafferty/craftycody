Listen, I am well aware of the tired, old stereotype that all women love shoes. Oh and well all need huge closets for all our shoes and oops! We keep maxing out our poor husband's credit cards.

Okay, but like. Shoes are rad.

I won't say they're my kryptonite. I've never spent money I didn't have on a pair (or anything really). I have, however, always had a fondness for shoes.

For a long time, it was boots. Fur boots, leather boots, thigh-high boots- you name it. I never had too many, but I had curated a nice collection some of which I still have.

Then came high heels. Hoo boy. Now heels I absolutely had a metric ton of. You could find them so cheap and there was so much variety. I love unique things and heels were no exception. I wish I had photos at the peak of my collection, but alas. I found great deals at discount stores like Ross and found little stores in strip malls that would sell two pairs for $15.
