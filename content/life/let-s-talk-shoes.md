Listen, I am well aware of the tired, old stereotype that all women love shoes. Oh and we all need huge closets for all our shoes and oops! We keep maxing out our poor husband's credit cards.

Okay, but like. Shoes are rad.

I won't say they're my kryptonite. I've never spent money I didn't have on a pair (or anything really). I have, however, always had a fondness for shoes.

For a long time, it was boots. Fur boots, leather boots, thigh-high boots- you name it. I never had too many, but I had curated a nice collection some of which I still have.

Then came high heels. Hoo boy. Now heels I absolutely had a metric ton of. You could find them so cheap and there was so much variety. I love unique things and heels were no exception. I wish I had photos at the peak of my collection, but alas. I found great deals at discount stores like Ross and found little stores in strip malls that would sell two pairs for $15.

As I got older, my care for fashion flew by the wayside. I wasn't going out nearly as much and getting together with friends consisted of movies or just hanging out at the house. There was no need for 7-inch stilettos anymore.

When I started moving from house to house with my now-husband, not every pair would make the move so the collection dwindled even more. Moving is a great time to do some spring cleaning, by the way, and shoes that I hadn't worn for 5 years stopped making the cut.

Then the pandemic happened and no one did anything anymore. We all devolved into sweatpants and messy buns. Which I honestly lived for. Masks were/are a great excuse to not feel like you have to plaster a full-face of makeup on just to run errands.

Now that it's sort-of-okay-sort-of-not to go out again, I'm rediscovering my style. Spoiler alert: I still really like shoes. However, this time it's turned into sneakers. I love a good pair of kicks. Unfortunately, it's my most expensive love affair to date. Fortunately, I'm a full-grown adult now. Life works in mysterious ways, doesn't it?

I still love unique shoes and, apparently, so does everyone else because there are some _wild_ kicks out there.
