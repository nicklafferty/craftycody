Listen, I am well aware of the tired, old stereotype that all women love shoes. Oh and well all need huge closets for all our shoes and oops! We keep maxing out our poor husband's credit cards.

Okay, but like. Shoes are rad.

I won't say they're my kryptonite. I've never spent money I didn't have on a pair (or anything really). I have, however, always had a fondness for shoes.

For a long time, I loved boots. Fur boots, leather boots, thigh-high boots- you name it. I never had too many, but I had curated a nice collection some of which I still have.

Then came high heels. Hoo boy. Now heels I absolutely had a metric ton of.
