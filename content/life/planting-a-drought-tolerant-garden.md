My favorite plants are anything hands-off. People think I have a green thumb, but what I actually have are plants that handle neglect well.

I've touched on [landscape design](https://craftycody.com/life/backyard-zen-garden/) before and it's certainly important when planning out your garden. However, today I'm going to talk about specific plants and how to care for them.

I'm going to be writing about plants that do well specifically in my area of Texas but don't worry! I'll tell you how you can find plants that thrive where you live too.

## How do I know so much about plants?

I'm currently a [Master Gardener trainee](https://mastergardener.tamu.edu/become/) and only a few volunteer hours short of getting my certification.

There are Master Gardener programs all over the country. Your state's agricultural school will most likely be the one sponsoring it.
