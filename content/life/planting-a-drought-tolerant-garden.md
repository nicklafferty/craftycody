My favorite plants are anything hands-off. People think I have a green thumb, but what I actually have are plants that handle neglect well.

I've touched on [landscape design](https://craftycody.com/life/backyard-zen-garden/) before and it's certainly important when planning out your garden. However, today I'm going to talk about specific plants and how to care for them.

I'm going to be writing about plants that do well specifically in my area of Texas but don't worry! I'll tell you how you can find plants that thrive where you live too.

## Where did I learn about plants?

I'm currently a [Master Gardener trainee](https://mastergardener.tamu.edu/become/) and only a few volunteer hours short of getting my certification. There are Master Gardener programs all over the country. Your state's agricultural school will most likely be the one sponsoring it.

You'll attend several hours of classes typically set up like a semester of school and then be required to complete a set number of volunteer hours. For instance, I have to complete 50 volunteer hours to get my certification, then it's 15 hours per year after that.

It's a lot of fun and a great way to get involved in your community. You'll meet tons of people and learn all kinds of interesting gardening techniques.

Before joining the MG program, I relied on Google and trial-and-error. There is so much information out there if you look for it.

## What zone you're in and why it matters

It's important to use plants that are meant for your zone's climate. The zone rating is a cold hardiness rating, not heat. Meaning if you're in zone 5 you can plant things that do well in zone 4, but not from zone 6. It gets too cold where you are and those plants would freeze. You could keep them in pots and bring them in in the winter, however.

I'm in zone 8, so I can plant just about anything from lower zones, but it's too cold here for the tropical plants of zones 9, 10, etc.
