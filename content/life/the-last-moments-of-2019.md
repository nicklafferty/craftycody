I know everyone says this, but this year has **flown by.** As we get older, time keeps getting faster and faster so it’s really important to enjoy, learn, and grow from every bit of it. Always be grateful for the “bad” and the “good”. Always always always say thank you to whatever you believe in.

And here we are at a new decade! So what am I thankful for? Well, everything for one, but really for all the people in my life. I am surrounded by love and support and I’m lucky to be able to say it’s always been like that. Sure there have been some toxic people sprinkled in, but they are speed bumps on this road I’m traveling. I’m thankful for them too because I wouldn’t be where I am today without them in some way or other.

I don’t really ever do New Year's resolutions because I feel like they are made to be broken. Do it if it’s your thing though! I’m not here to yuck anyone’s yum. I’m just not a goal-oriented person, but there are things I’m looking forward to in 2020. Hopefully, I will make my first sale this year- got a whole 365 days to do it!

So have fun tonight and ring in the New Year safely! I will see you all in 2020!
