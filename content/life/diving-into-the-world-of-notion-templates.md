My husband has always been a fan of Notion and has written about them on his own blog quite a bit. When he came to me to see if I'd like to start designing Notion templates I really didn't have a clue what he was talking about. I knew what Notion was, but I didn't realize there was this whole world of templates you could create from scratch to help people get organized.

We all already know that I enjoy making woodworking plans and crochet patterns for digital releases. It keeps costs down and I like getting creative when making my PDFs- as well as the projects themselves.
