I can finally breathe. It has been a _really_ long couple of months. _Really. Long._ To be honest, I’m thankful that all that stress has solely been because of work and not anything to do with friends/family/fur babies/health/finances/etc.

That being said, holy crap am I’m glad it’s all done! I was finally able to come up for air this week and work has come to a screeching halt as I conquered the pile. I’ve probably edited about 1000 photos in the last 2 months and I am ready to win the lottery and retire. But really, it might be time for a profession change in 2020- we shall see :D.

## Christmas

Truer words. That’s where our Christmas tree is right now. The room is dark and it’s the only light on. It’s magical. This is the first year we’ve had a tree. Nick said we could get one because he knows how much I love Christmas, but at the same time, I know how much of a pain moving a ton of decorations can be.

It began when his company announced they were having a decorating contest and, being who I am, decided we needed to win. We both work from home, so we outfitted his office with as much Christmas stuff as we could. I DIYed a bunch of it, but the crown jewel was definitely my new, beautiful tree.

The wrapping paper wallpaper was his idea and I’ve never loved him more than I did at that moment, haha. We didn’t win the contest (due in part to some in-office vote fraud), but it was fun nonetheless. And I got to make some new Christmas decor I wouldn’t have gotten to otherwise. Lose-win-win.

This year we’re heading to Dallas for Christmas to see my family. It’s the first time we’ve split up the holidays between parents. Nick and I have been together for over 7 years and we waited until we were married to do so, haha. Our parents lived pretty close to one another so it just made sense to each go to our own parent’s house to celebrate. However, Nick’s folks moved about an hour away from us this year after they retired and sold their house. That versus the 3.5 – 4 hours it takes to get to Dallas and now we split the holidays up.

This will be the first time I celebrate a proper holiday with a significant other. Isn’t that weird? I mean, you do one thing for so long you just get used to it, but this year I will wake up Christmas morning and get to celebrate with Nick (and my parents). I’m pretty excited.

## Crafts

I’ve been slowly starting to craft more. It’s been a great way to relax and I ought to get to focus some more on my YouTube channel now that things have calmed down.

## Adventures

We’ve also been going out more on the weekends. Something is always going on here in Austin and last week we went to [Luminations at the Wildflower Center.](https://do512family.com/luminations-at-wildflower-center/)

Oof, I think that’s about all for now. Seems like all I was doing was working….because I was, haha uughhhh. Now it’s finally time to have some fun. More Christmas posts soon. ![❤](https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/svg/2764.svg)
