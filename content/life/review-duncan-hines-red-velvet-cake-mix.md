+++
I've been baking for many years and, for the most part, enjoy it quite a bit. For the effort you put in, you get more food that lasts longer than when you cook dinner and everyone is done eating in 10 minutes.

However, sometimes I just don't feel like making everything from scratch. It takes time, I might not have an ingredient, or, like in this case, my tried and true recipe has disappeared from the internet.

I had a great recipe for red velvet cupcakes and homemade icing. They were always a hit, but when I decided to make them a couple of weeks ago the recipe had been deleted from the website. I was pretty upset. Now I have to find a new recipe and vet it before making it for people. It's always a hassle and red velvet can be particularly time-consuming.

So, this time, I decided to get some box mix and a tub of frosting. When I went to the store, the only brand that had red velvet mix was Duncan Hines. I've tried their box mix in the past and wasn't impressed (mmm cardboard flavor), but it's been years and it's only a couple of bucks so I thought why not.

I followed the instructions to a T and made them yesterday. 

Once again I was underwhelmed.

## Taste

I can't even say they tasted bad, because they didn't taste like anything. There was hardly any flavor at all. Really the cupcakes were a delivery method for the icing. Very bland.

## Frosting

I got cream cheese frosting and it was pretty good. I think I went with the Pilsbury brand. It was the only thing you could taste, so I'm glad it was a positive experience.

## Final thoughts

Unfortunately, there isn't much to say about them. They work in a pinch, I guess? They're cheap and make a lot of cupcakes so that's nice. I really wish another brand would come out with a red velvet box mix. Maybe they have and my store just doesn't sell it.

Either way, I'm going to have to find a new recipe online. If you have a great red velvet cupcake recipe, let your girl know.
