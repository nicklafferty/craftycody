When we bought this house, the yard looked nice. I believe the previous owner really loved taking care of the lawn. However, there wasn't much in the way of gardens, plants, or ornamentation.

We started renovating immediately after purchasing and moved in once the reno was completed. Since we weren't in the house for a couple of months during the summer, the lawn suffered for it. We were left with a mostly dead yard in the front and back.

Slowly but surely we've been dethatching the thick, dead grass and creating flower beds. Well, cactus beds really. I love plants, but I loathe babying them. I look for full sun, drought tolerant, deer resistant, perennials that do well in Texas. Basically, I want to stick them in the ground and forget about them while also attracting bees and hummingbirds.

I'll try and be as thorough as possible with what we're doing to our yard. It's an ongoing process!

## Landscaping resources

It feels incredibly daunting at first, but it's surprisingly easy to do. You have to start in small sections instead of taking on the whole yard in one big go. Unless you're hiring a landscaping company, then go for it.

A great resource is the [Texas A&M Horticulture site](https://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/). There are all kinds of plants and ideas in there to make DIY landscaping simple and beautiful. Really all it takes is a lot of time...and some money, but mostly time.

The [Ladybird Johnson Wildflower Center's website ](https://www.wildflower.org/plants-main)also has a plethora of information about native plants. I'm probably on this site daily looking up how to care for the various plants in my yard. It's super helpful and gave me the idea to put my frog fruit in hanging baskets versus making it groundcover.

If you have a local discovery center or similar, keep an eye out for plant sales. They usually get them donated then sell them to help the center. Ours just had a sale and plants started at $2.50- you cannot beat it! It's hard for big box stores to compete, however they are more convenient.

A&M also has Master Gardener classes and certifications where you can learn all about plant life and become an expert. I'm planning on joining the next session whenever classes start again. In the meantime, I got [Neil Sperry's book Lone Star Gardening](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0991620704/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=codybear0e-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0991620704&linkId=74f76ac6c171a16d6200b8a0ce2c284e) that outlines all kinds of native plants and has a calendar of when you should plant what. He's super informative and also hosts a radio show about gardening. His book is [less expensive on his website.](https://neilsperry.com/store/5th-printing-of-neil-sperrys-lone-star-gardening/)

You can find lots of ideas and tips on [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/). There are entire collections dedicated to urban gardening, fairy gardens, Japanese-inspired backyards, xeriscaping, outdoor entertaining, DIYs and the list goes on.

## Front yard

Our front yard was in the roughest shape. The trees aren't big enough to provide much shade and the sun just beats down all day, every day. The grass was fried. There were two garden beds under the windows that had less than ideal plants- particularly the bed under our large, picture window. These beds were the first things we changed.

### Window beds

They were lined with old landscape fabric and the beds themselves were bordered with wood beams that were absolutely filled with termites. I love wood as much as the next person, but you really have to be careful when putting it out in your yard because you can invite pests and rot if not done properly. We tossed the wood and my FIL brought some beautiful stone bricks to re-line the beds with and I love them. They look cleaner and more professional in my opinion. Also, termites don't eat stone!

We also pulled out the plants under the picture window. My husband wasn't a fan and they looked like they might be dead anyway. I didn't have a preference, but I love making things ours so I was happy to replace them with a bunch of pretty flowers. Hopefully, we'll get some bees and hummingbirds as these babies grow.

I took some clippings of English Ivy we have growing on the fence in our backyard. I stuck them in some water and after a couple of weeks, new roots began to grow. I planted some so that they will grow up our stark, white brick and add a lovely cottage feel.

### Pathway

There were stepping stones leading from the sidewalk to the driveway. I thought this was a nice idea since you'd be walking through the grass otherwise. The stones that were there were sunken into the ground and I thought they needed an update. I pulled them all up just by sticking a garden spade into the dirt and using the leverage to pop them out. Then, I connected the holes they left by digging a trench between them. I tried to keep the width as even I could, but it was fairly laborious work, haha. I love square stepping stone so I got seven 12" ones from Lowe's, some black gravel, landscape fabric, and black mulch. I put the fabric down in my new trench and secured it with landscape pins. I put the mulch on top, then the stones, and then filled in around everything with the gravel. It didn't come out perfect, but I really like the look and as I first try I don't think it's too bad.

Around the stepping stones, I planted some perennial seeds and mulched around the new beds. Hopefully, these grow like crazy and add some new color to the yard.

### Yard

The grass was toast when we finally moved in. We treated it with some lawn fertilizer and it's slowly coming back, but it was a good time to start dethatching and putting in garden beds since it was dead anyway. You don't have to feel guilty about pulling up lush grass. The layer of dead grass was incredibly thick so this took some heavy elbow grease. We only used a [steel rake](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Blue-Hawk-54-5-in-L-Fiberglass-Handle-Welded-Steel-Garden-Rake/3605434?cm_mmc=shp-_-c-_-prd-_-sol-_-google-_-lia-_-106-_-lawnandgardentools-_-3605434-_-0&placeholder=null&ds_rl=1286981&gclid=Cj0KCQjw6-SDBhCMARIsAGbI7UiV8kJcsmNlReYUMhWu-QNTX5nyYwR75h6GrZKxTj46_U_QMte9tkEaAl1oEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds), no fancy equipment.

### Plant beds

We've added two, large plant beds to the front of the yard. Both are filled with drought and deer-resistant plants, most kinds you would find in the desert. Eventually, I would love to xeriscape the whole thing.

## Backyard

Why is 'backyard' one word and 'front yard' two words?

Anyway, the backyard was one of the reasons I loved the house. You can reno the house itself and make it look however you want, but giant trees are hard to come by. It's near impossible to plant 40-year-old trees to get the feeling I wanted when we were looking for a home. When I saw this house had 5 old trees in the backyard, it was pretty much a done deal for me. I wish there were some in the front, but the two that are out there will grow...eventually.

There were a lot of wild shrubs and weeds along the back fence and some sad-looking plants in the bed below our bedroom window. For the most part, our backyard was a blank canvas.

### Deck

I repainted the deck itself from a rusty red color to a mossy green with dark blue accents. I was originally going to strip the paint and stain it, but the deck is kind of crappy for lack of a better word. I have a feeling we're going to have to replace the whole thing eventually and I didn't want to do all that work. Plus, painting is fun and you get to add more color which, now that our house is solid white, we were in need of.

### Window bed

The same plants that were in the front bed were here as well. I forget what they're called, but we weren't keen on them. We took them out and cleaned out the bed. In their place, I planted two, cute dwarf palmettos I bought at the Discovery Center sale. They do well in full shade and are slow growers, but are also very drought tolerant. They haven't grown much since I planted them a few months ago, but they are still green!

I also added some of that English ivy back here. The wall is huge and the green ivy will look great once it's able to creep up and mature.

### Vegetable garden

We've grown pepper plants at previous houses, but never a full garden. I wanted raised beds, so I bought a little kit at Lowe's and put it together. I also looked into square foot gardening which is really, really neat! If you're new to gardening, definitely check it out. It makes it approachable and simple for newbs like myself.

I laid out my grid pattern and looked up how much space each veggie would need and got to planting. Everything is growing and couldn't have been easier. Besides water, it really takes care of itself. I can't wait to harvest!

### Plant beds

We had one and a half (sort of) beds next to the deck. There was a dilapidated lattice barely attached to the end of the deck with some kind of something (we think roses) growing up it. It was actually quite a hazard and while the reno was going on we decided to dispose of it in the dumpster we rented.

After it was all cleared out, I was able to section off a proper bed to plant in. We wanted a pseudo-privacy wall and I looked into building one but had always been a fan of bamboo. It's also a lot cheaper. I reached bamboo species because I know they can be incredibly invasive and came across [Bamboo Plants Online](https://bambooplantsonline.com/). I ordered two pots of clumping, non-invasive [Seabreeze bamboo](https://bambooplantsonline.com/products/seabreeze) and followed their videos for planting instructions. It's very straightforward and I'm hoping to have a cool, green bamboo thicket to provide some privacy. They even survived the [harsh cold front that swept through Texas](https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2021/03/16/unprecedented-texas-cold-snap/) a couple of months ago.

Around the bamboo are the cacti that we've had for several years, but didn't want to plant since we were renters. They finally have a home!

In the front of the bed, we planted one lavender and two Gregg's mistflower. They're all perennials and should have beautiful purple blooms.

In the half-bed, I put a star jasmine plant that I'm hoping will grow up the wall and break up all that white brick. I'll have to get a bigger trellis eventually since they don't stick to walls.

There were tons of weird weed/shrubs along the back fence that were in rough shape. We pulled most of them out and started a new bed in the back corner of our yard. It's pretty shady back there, so we bought shrubs that did well in low light. There are a couple of sages, hosta, and coleus.
