+++
I literally just finished packing up my tools from this project and wanted to write a quick tutorial of how I install our new Google Nest floodlight.

My husband has been eyeing this thing for what seemed like months and it was _finally_ released the other day. We ran to Best Buy to pick one up and to Lowe's for a junction box then I got started the next morning on the install.

Spoiler alert: there was one more Lowe's run in my future.

I'll go over the issues I ran into, the exact supplies I bought, and do my best to explain how I installed our floodlight into a brick wall.

## Supplies:

 1. [Google Nest Cam with floodlight](https://store.google.com/us/product/nest_cam_floodlight?hl=en-US)
 2. [Hammer Drill](https://www.lowes.com/pd/DEWALT-1-2-in-Corded-Hammer-Drill/3032367) (you have to have this when drilling into brick)
 3. [Concrete Screws](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Tapcon-8-Pack-1-1-4-in-x-3-16-in-Concrete-Anchors/3044002) (3/16"; 1 1/4" length)
 4. [Drill bit](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Tapcon-3-1-2-in-Carbide-Masonry-Drill-Bit-for-Hammer-Drill/1260139) (5/32")
 5. [Nut driver with hex bit ](https://www.lowes.com/pd/DEWALT-1-4-in-x-1-7-8-in-Standard-SAE-Hex-Nut-Driver/999928912)(1/4")
 6. Compressed air for cleaning dust
 7. [Junction box](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Sigma-Electric-Round-Weatherproof-Box-White-Metal-Weatherproof-New-Work-Standard-Round-Exterior-Electrical-Box/3152543)
 8. Outdoor caulk for waterproofing
 9. Safety glasses
10. Ear protection

## How-to:

Those links are to the exact products I used in this project.

We decided we wanted a camera for the front of our house and chose a spot where an old, worn-out light was installed. The wiring would already be there, so it should be fairly straightforward. And, it was thankfully. I did have to run to Lowe's a second time after buying the junction box to get all the masonry screws because I was hoping to be able to install the camera using what was already there, but it wouldn't have fit.

The first step is to turn the power off to the light at the breaker- MAKE SURE YOU DO THIS. Once the power is 100% off, I started to dismantle the old light. Simple enough- take off mounting screws, take off light, clip connected wires (white, black, and ground), throw light away, and then take off the old mounting hardware. There was a surprise junction box already inside of the brick, but it had no way to connect all the new stuff, so I'm glad we went ahead a got a new box.

What was nice about the concrete screws was the instructions on the back. They said the exact size drill bit you would need to predrill as well as the size of the nut driver to drill in the screws themselves. Another bonus is that all of these products are pretty inexpensive so I ran around the store grabbing everything I needed.

Once all the old light stuff was off, I was left with a hole, a black wire, a white wire, and a loose ground wire because it was secured to one of the little brackets holding up the old lamp. This ending up being fine, so don't worry if yours doesn't come out of the wall either.

Next, I put my new junction box against the brick and used a sharpie to mark where the two mounting holes landed. Be sure to drill into the brick itself and NOT the mortar.

Using that 5/32" drill bit in my hammer drill, I drilled into those marked spots and through the brick. You need to pre-drill otherwise you risk cracking the brick- the same as pre-drilling through wood. Also, be sure to pre-drill longer than the length of your screws.
