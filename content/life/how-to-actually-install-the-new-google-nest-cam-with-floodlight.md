+++
I literally just finished packing up my tools from this project and wanted to write a quick tutorial of how I install our new Google Nest floodlight.

My husband has been eyeing this thing for what seemed like months and it was _finally_ released the other day. We ran to Best Buy to pick one up and to Lowe's for a junction box then I got started the next morning on the install.

Spoiler alert: there was one more Lowe's run in my future.

I'll go over the issues I ran into and do my best to explain how I installed our floodlight into a brick wall.

## Supplies:

Google Nest Cam with floodlight  
Hammer Drill (you have to have this when drilling into brick)  
Concrete Screws  
Drill bit  
Hex bit  
Compressed air (for cleaning dust)  
Junction box
