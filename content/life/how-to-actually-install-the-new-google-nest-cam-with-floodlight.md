+++
I literally just finished packing up my tools from this project and wanted to write a quick tutorial of how I install our new Google Nest floodlight.

My husband has been eyeing this thing for what seemed like months and it was _finally_ released the other day. We ran to Best Buy to pick one up and to Lowe's for a junction box then I got started the next morning on the install.

Spoiler alert: there was one more Lowe's run in my future.

I'll go over the issues I ran into, the exact supplies I bought, and do my best to explain how I installed our floodlight into a brick wall.

## Supplies:

1. [Google Nest Cam with floodlight](https://store.google.com/us/product/nest_cam_floodlight?hl=en-US)
2. [Hammer Drill](https://www.lowes.com/pd/DEWALT-1-2-in-Corded-Hammer-Drill/3032367) (you have to have this when drilling into brick)
3. [Concrete Screws](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Tapcon-8-Pack-1-1-4-in-x-3-16-in-Concrete-Anchors/3044002) (3/16"; 1 1/4" length)
4. [Drill bit](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Tapcon-3-1-2-in-Carbide-Masonry-Drill-Bit-for-Hammer-Drill/1260139) (5/32")
5. [Nut driver with hex bit ](https://www.lowes.com/pd/DEWALT-1-4-in-x-1-7-8-in-Standard-SAE-Hex-Nut-Driver/999928912)(1/4")
6. Compressed air for cleaning dust
