This year has been the year of the beach. This is my third beach vacation and my husband's 1283rd, which includes work trips to be fair.

I was never much of a beachgoer until I met my husband. They're one of his favorite vacation spots, but I tend to agree with Anakin Skywalker:

_"I don't like sand. It's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere."_

That plus the sun and heat don't make beaches my first choice.
