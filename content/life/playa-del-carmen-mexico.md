This year has been the year of the beach. This is my third beach vacation and my husband's 1283rd, which includes work trips to be fair.

I was never much of a beachgoer until I met my husband. They're one of his favorite vacation spots, but I tend to agree with Anakin Skywalker:

_"I don't like sand. It's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere."_

That plus the sun and heat don't make beaches my first choice.

However, Nick is typically very good at planning vacations so I'm happy to go wherever. As long as we're not working and just enjoying our time together, I don't really care where we go.

## Playa del Carmen

We decided on Mexico since it had been so long since we traveled internationally (or traveled at all, thank you covid). It's also an easy flight from Austin- about 2 hours and you're in a different country with completely different scenery.

Playa seemed like it had a lot to do and had lovely beaches. Be careful what time of year you go though because I hear there is a stinky seaweed season that's good to avoid.

There are lots of activities, restaurants, and shopping to be had in Playa. It's a high-trafficked tourist destination so you're going to get hassled a lot while out and about. Just say no and keep walking- we didn't run into any real issues.

Another great thing about Playa is that it's a 40-minute ferry ride to Cozumel, which also has lots of activities, restaurants, and shopping.

Both places are beautiful and look like postcards so to speak. I would take the time to download Duolingo and brush up on some Spanish. It will help a ton. Also, it's hot and humid all of the time so pack accordingly.

And only drink **bottled water** or soda.

## Hotel

We stayed at the [Grand Hyatt Resort](https://www.hyatt.com/en-US/hotel/mexico/grand-hyatt-playa-del-carmen-resort/cunpc) in Playa. Keep in mind we travel almost exclusively with credit card points (hotels and flights). It's how we can go to so many places. We'd go broke staying at all of the places we do with cash. ðŸ˜…

### The good

It's a stunning property and the pool is fantastic. The beach is only a few steps away, but you will have people walk up to you to get you to buy something. The restaurants there are tasty and the food is actually fairly priced. It was cheaper than the hotel we stayed at in Miami and I think you'll find that's the case in Mexico, even in the touristy spots. It's pretty inexpensive.

### The not-so-good

I will say, and I'm not trying to be snobby, that the hotel was less than helpful with a couple of things. They do not have an ATM that gives pesos (I think you'll find it hard to find one that does. They really want you to spend dollars so they can set their own exchange rates.) and they also do not set up covid testing for international travelers. Their suggestion was, "There are a few places on 5th street that do testing!" after we had just checked two of those places and one was "out of tests" and the other was closed despite being labeled as open. While I don't need someone to hold my hand, this is kind of what hotel concierges are for especially for those who are unfamiliar with an area. I found a great testing location that actually came to our hotel and the hotel said they have a room set aside for just that thing. Well, guess what room was suddenly unavailable when it came time even though we reserved it? Just little annoyances like that put me off because their rooms are between $300-$1000 per night. Again, we use points and don't have status, so maybe that has something to do with it.
