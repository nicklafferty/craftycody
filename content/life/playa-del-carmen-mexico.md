This year has been the year of the beach. This is my third beach vacation and my husband's 1283rd, which includes work trips to be fair.

I was never much of a beachgoer until I met my husband. They're one of his favorite vacation spots, but I tend to agree with Anakin Skywalker:

_"I don't like sand. It's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere."_

That plus the sun and heat don't make beaches my first choice.

However, Nick is typically very good at planning vacations so I'm happy to go wherever. As long as we're not working and just enjoying our time together, I don't really care where we go.

## Playa del Carmen

We decided on Mexico since it had been so long since we traveled internationally (or traveled at all, thank you covid). It's also an easy flight from Austin- about 2 hours and you're in a different country with completely different scenery.

Playa seemed like it had a lot to do and had lovely beaches. Be careful what time of year you go though because I hear there is a stinky seaweed season that's good to avoid.

There are lots of activities, restaurants, and shopping to be had in Playa. It's a high-trafficked tourist destination so you're going to get hassled a lot while out and about. Just say no and keep walking- we didn't run into any real issues.

Another great thing about Playa is that it's a 40-minute ferry ride to Cozumel, which also has lots of activities, restaurants, and shopping.

Both places are beautiful and look like postcards so to speak. I would take the time to download Duolingo and brush up on some Spanish. It will help a ton. Also, it's hot and humid all of the time so pack accordingly.
