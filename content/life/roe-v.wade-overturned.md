I frankly do not care what you're opinion on abortion is. If you don't agree with it, then feel free to navigate away from this post.

This is a heavy topic I'm writing about today, but feel like it's necessary because something that has been considered a right has been stripped away today.

The Supreme Court has ruled this morning, Friday June 24, 2022, to overturn Roe v. Wade and effectively ban our rights to abortions. Thirteen states, including Texas, have what are called trigger laws meaning the second Roe is overturned all abortion protection, or what's left of it, is taken away and all abortion is made illegal.

What can we do as Texans?
