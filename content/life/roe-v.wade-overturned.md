I frankly do not care what you're opinion on abortion is. If you disagree with it, then feel free to navigate away from this post.

This is a heavy topic I'm writing about today, but I feel like it's necessary because something that has been considered a right has been stripped away today.

The Supreme Court has ruled this morning, Friday June 24, 2022, to overturn Roe v. Wade and effectively ban our rights to abortions. Thirteen states, including Texas, have trigger laws, meaning the second Roe was overturned all abortion protection, or what's left of it, is taken away and all abortion is made illegal.

## Where can we go now that abortion is illegal?

Unfortunately, Texas sits in the middle of other states with anti-abortion legislation and, even if we didn't, Texas is so big it takes forever to cross a border in any direction.

However, that's what we have to do now, isn't it.

I am by no means an expert on any of this, but here are some resources that may help you find the care you need:

1. [Planned Parenthood](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/)
2. [The Auntie Network](https://www.reddit.com/r/auntienetwork/)
3. [Two X Chromosomes](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/)
4. Local women's clinics
5. Florida (15-week ban), Colorado (protected right), Kansas (likely to be illegal come August), and New Mexico (unprotected, but likely to remain legal) are the closest states to us where abortion is still legal.
