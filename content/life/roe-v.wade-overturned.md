_I frankly do not care what your opinion on abortion is. If you disagree with it, then feel free to navigate away from this post._

This is a heavy topic I'm writing about today, but I feel like it's necessary because something that has been considered a right has been stripped away.

The Supreme Court has ruled this morning, Friday June 24, 2022, to overturn Roe v. Wade and effectively ban our rights to abortions. Thirteen states, including Texas, have trigger laws, meaning the second Roe was overturned all abortion protection, or what's left of it, was taken away and all abortion is made illegal. These laws may go into effect within moments of the ruling or can take upwards of 30 days.

## Where can we go now that abortion is illegal?

Unfortunately, Texas sits in the middle of other states with anti-abortion legislation and, even if we didn't, Texas is so big it takes forever to cross a border in any direction.

However, that's what we have to do now, isn't it.

I am by no means an expert on any of this, but here are some resources that may help you find the care you need:

1. [Planned Parenthood](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/)
2. [The Auntie Network](https://www.reddit.com/r/auntienetwork/)
3. [Two X Chromosomes](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/)
4. Local women's clinics
5. Florida (15-week ban), Colorado (protected), Kansas (likely to be illegal come August), and New Mexico (unprotected, but likely to remain legal) are the closest states to us where abortion is still legal.

Even more resources:

## Are all abortions illegal now?

Unless they are deemed "necessary to save the mother's life" then yes, all abortion is illegal unless the state specifically protects it (or doesn't make it inherently illegal).

There are few, if any, exceptions made in these laws for rape and incest.

And let me be perfectly clear on what that means. If your 12-year-old daughter is raped by some pedophile, who may even be a family member, and becomes pregnant there is **no protection** in the state of Texas for her. She has to have that baby.

## What does medically necessary mean?

It means continuing the pregnancy would be life-threatening to the mother. Here are some examples:

1. Water can break too early in pregnancy and cause infection
2. Placental abruption is when the placenta separates from the uterus
3. Preeclampsia, high blood pressure leading to organ damage
4. Exhauserbating pre-existing conditions
5. Prolonging cancer treatments
6. Incomplete miscarriages can lead to sepsis
7. Ectopic pregnancies

These are the ones I found with a quick Google search. There are all kinds of things that can go wrong during pregnancy even in 2022.

## What are the stages of pregnancy?

I feel like this is important to understand because a lot of people believe that life begins at conception which, scientifically, isn't true. For a long time, it's merely a pile of cells developing inside a uterus- there is no life, it's not viable. We have to get away from calling fetuses and placentas "babies" because they just aren't.

[Planned Parenthood describes the stages of pregnancy](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/pregnancy/pregnancy-month-by-month) very well and illustrates what's going on in the body.

## Why do politicians care so much about my body?

It's control masked as religion. They want to control you. They want you to give birth to more taxpayers.

The religious angle is used to fire up voters, but it's bait. Politicians can easily access abortion for their daughters and mistresses. It doesn't affect Ted Cruz that abortion is illegal in Texas.

"Our most precious Texans" is rhetoric we've been hearing a lot from Texan politicians. They will fight tooth and nail to protect unborn zygotes, but the second they are born the government couldn't care less. It's made evident when [school shootings happen like in Ulvade](https://www.texastribune.org/series/uvalde-texas-school-shooting/). They are blaming absolutely everything else except the damn guns.

Guns have more rights than women in Texas.

Let me repeat that:

**GUNS HAVE MORE RIGHTS THAN WOMEN IN TEXAS.**
