I finally finished a set! I always start with one character then never get around to making their counterpart. Well, now that's a thing of the past because Hades is done!

You can find him and Persephone for sale in my Etsy shop. Grab the bundle for a little discount!

If you haven't yet, be sure to give [Lore Olympus](https://www.webtoons.com/en/romance/lore-olympus/list?title_no=1320&page=1) a read. That's what inspired these patterns. They're purely a homage to the comic- I am in no way affiliated with Lore Olympus.
