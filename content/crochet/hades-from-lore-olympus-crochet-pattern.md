I finally finished a set! I always start with one character then never get around to making their counterpart. Well, now that's a thing of the past because Hades is done!

You can find him and Persephone for sale in my Etsy shop. Grab the bundle for a little discount!

Like Persephone, he's very simple in his design. I used a larger hook to create the height difference but still used weight 4 yarn. That's really the only yarn I use so I have to make patterns that work with it. I also think it's more commonly available and inexpensive, at least here in the US.

If you haven't yet, be sure to give [Lore Olympus](https://www.webtoons.com/en/romance/lore-olympus/list?title_no=1320&page=1) a read. That's what inspired these patterns. They're purely a homage to the comic- I am in no way affiliated with Lore Olympus.
