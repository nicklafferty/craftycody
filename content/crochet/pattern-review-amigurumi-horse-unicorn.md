I couldn't help myself. The second I finished [Hades](https://craftycody.com/crochet/hades-crochet-pattern/), I bought the yarn and pattern I needed to make Chirkatoys' super cute unicorn.

I previously reviewed her [elephant pattern](https://craftycody.com/crochet/crochet-elephant-review/) as well.

I absolutely fell in love with this little unicorn on her [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/chirka_toys/?hl=en) and knew I had to make her for myself.

These patterns are so wonderful. They use simple techniques and work up so quickly that they make great, last-minute gifts if you're a crocheter who works well under pressure.

## Pattern

## Yarn

I don't usually order yarn. It can be expensive, and I don't find myself needing that much for any given project to justify the cost/shipping.

However, I needed all-new yarn for this project. I knew I wanted to make it soft and squishy and the majority of my yarn is weight 4, so it's a little bit more difficult to make large projects.

I knew this pattern used Himalaya yarn, but I'm skeptical about ordering it because shipping takes so long to the US. I was concerned I would be short and have to order more, but I also didn't want to order too much right off the bat.

I found an alternative yarn that I think is very comparable to the Himalaya brand. I bought seven skeins of [Premier Yarns Parfait Chunky](https://www.premieryarns.com/collections/parfait-yarns/products/parfchunky) in bubblegum, lilac, seaside, tangerine, key lime, and white.

Their website has a minimum order ($75) to qualify for free shipping and shipping costs $11. They also sell through Walmart and the shipping is free no matter the order size. The downside here is you will not get the points you would if you ordered through their website. You can get some cashback if you [shop using Rakuten](https://www.rakuten.com/r/CKREUL3?eeid=28187)!

I wanted something textured for her hair and ended up getting one skein of [Bernat Pipsqueak yarn in candy girl](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Bernat-Bulky-100-Polyester-Candy-Girl-Yarn-101-yd/17474581).
