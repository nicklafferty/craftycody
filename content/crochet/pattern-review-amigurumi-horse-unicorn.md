I couldn't help myself. The second I finished [Hades](https://craftycody.com/crochet/hades-crochet-pattern/), I bought the yarn and pattern I needed to make Chirkatoys' super cute unicorn.

I previously reviewed her [elephant pattern](https://craftycody.com/crochet/crochet-elephant-review/) as well.

I absolutely fell in love with this little unicorn on her [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/chirka_toys/?hl=en) and knew I had to make her for myself.

These patterns are so wonderful. They use simple techniques and work up so quickly that they make great, last-minute gifts if you're a crocheter who works well under pressure.
