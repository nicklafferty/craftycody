I'm going to try and write this up as quickly as I can. We've got exactly 14 days until Valentine's Day and it's officially crunch time. I'm not a fast crocheter so I need about 2 months notice before making anything, but some of you are super quick and can whip up incredible projects in no time.

I've put together a shortlist of some of my favorite, Valentine's Day tangential patterns. I will try to only include ones that work up quickly.

Let me know if you've tried any of these or have your own!

[**La Vie en Rose Earflap Hat**](https://kirstenhollowaydesigns.com/2016/11/la-vie-en-rose-baby-hat-3-6-months.html) **by Kirsten Holloway Designs**

I've made this hat on several occasions. The first one I did a Hufflepuff theme of black and gold. There is also a [matching scarf](https://kirstenhollowaydesigns.com/2017/11/la-vie-en-rose-free-ladies-crochet-scarf-pattern.html)! The soft pink used in this pattern is so romantic, but you could use any color you'd like of course. They work up quickly, but look very intricate and would be a great gift to someone special.

[**Unicorn macaron**](https://paintitcolorful.blogspot.com/2017/08/unicorn-macaron-amigurumi-pattern.html) **by A Little Love Everyday**

This was one of the first amigurumi I made when I got back into crochet a few years ago. The roses on top make this little unicorn extra sweet. She also has a bunch of free amigurumi patterns that look like they'd work up quickly and are SO cute.

[**Vintage-inspired bracelet**](http://createbellacreate.blogspot.com/2012/01/vintage-inspired-crochet-bracelet.html) **by Bella Feagins**

Another pattern I tried years ago when getting my hooks back out after a long hiatus. I love 1800s antiques and clothing and this fits the bill. It's very dainty and works up super fast. You could make matching cuffs to go with your outfit.

[**Valentine earflap hat**](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/valentine-earflap-hat) **by Valentine Tsvyrko**

Definitely a unique hat perfect for Valentine's Day. Doesn't use much yarn and includes sizes from toddler to adult. You could also pick a non-pink-themed colorway to make it more subdued or go totally crazy with it. She has several unique and stylish hats available in her Ravelry shop as well.

[**Valentine Cupcake**](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/valentine-cupcake) **by Elisa Sartori**

Where would Valentine's be without dessert? I think food amigurumi are some of the cutest there are and this is no exception. Combine with her [Valentine envelope pattern](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1152231602/crochet-pattern-valentine-letter?click_key=ec49b716b47b7350d74898742864b6121faecdf5%3A1152231602&click_sum=e6004c53&ref=shop_home_recs_2&crt=1) and you have a great gift set!

[**Makeup remover pads**](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/make-up-removerpads-puff) **by Sharon de Vaal**

If you're anything like me, you wear your best makeup when going _out_. It doesn't happen often, but when it does you're busting out that smokey eye and falsies. The real problem is when you come home and you realize you're out of makeup wipes. I have a few of these in my bathroom drawer for just such an emergency. I wash them off in the sink wash some dish soap and they're as good as new.

[**Valentine's Heart ornament**](https://www.stonegnome.com/2018/02/a-valentines-heart-for-you.html) **by Heidi Eisner**

A lovely little ornament to decorate your coffee bar with. I follow some crafters on Instagram who decorate their Christmas trees for each holiday and this would be a wonderful addition to a Valentines tree. She also has some helpful guides about learning Tunisian crochet if you're interested.

[Valentine's Day Mug Cozy](https://yarnandchai.com/valentines-day-mug-cozy/) by Rebecca Langford

I could (and should) make a mug cozy for every holiday and mood. I love them and yarn lends itself well to insulating your hands against a hot mug.
