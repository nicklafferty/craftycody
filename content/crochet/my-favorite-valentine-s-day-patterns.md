I'm going to try and write this up as quickly as I can. We've got exactly 14 days until Valentine's Day and it's officially crunch time. I'm not a fast crocheter so I need about 2 months notice, but some of you are super quick and can whip up some incredible projects in no time.

I've put together a shortlist of some of my favorite, Valentine's Day tangential patterns. I will try to only include ones that work up quickly.

Let me know if you've tried any of these or have your own!

[**La Vie en Rose Earflap Hat**](https://kirstenhollowaydesigns.com/2016/11/la-vie-en-rose-baby-hat-3-6-months.html) **by Kirsten Holloway Designs**

I've made this hat on several occasions. The first one I did a Hufflepuff theme of black and gold. There is also a [matching scarf](https://kirstenhollowaydesigns.com/2017/11/la-vie-en-rose-free-ladies-crochet-scarf-pattern.html)! The soft pink used in this pattern is so romantic, but you could use any color you'd like of course. They work up quickly, but look very intricate and would be a great gift to someone special.
