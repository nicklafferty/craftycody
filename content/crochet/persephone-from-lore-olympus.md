About a month ago, I told a good friend of mine that I was going on a short trip and wouldn't be around for our weekly movie night. She asked if I had read or heard of [Lore Olympus](https://www.webtoons.com/en/romance/lore-olympus/list?title_no=1320&page=1). I told her I got ads for it but didn't really know what it was about let alone read it.

That all changed.

I read it on the plane and in the evenings during my trip. I had such a lovely backlog that I'd spend a chunk of my afternoons casually reading in the sunroom after I got back home.

I hadn't realized I reached the end until I hit "next episode" and it asked if I wanted to pay to get the next episode early. I was devastated and now I'm stuck waiting week to week like everyone else.

However, whenever I fall hard into a fandom, I have to crochet something related to it. This brings me to my newest pattern release!

**Persephone!**

My pretty new pattern is now [available on my Etsy page](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1230827966/persephone-the-goddess-of-spring-crochet?click_key=e9e831fa95c2e4417b661caf2a5894db47da2fdd%3A1230827966&click_sum=bf12bd3a&ref=shop_home_feat_4). I'd like to make it clear that while I made up the pattern, Lore Olympus was created by the talented [Rachel Smythe](). Be sure to check out Webtoons and give it a read if you haven't already. I'm not usually into romance, but it's such a delicious guilty pleasure.

Also, I did something different with this one and made the pattern using [Figma](). I have a free account and this isn't sponsored, but I had a lot of fun learning a new program. It was a little daunting at first, I'll admit, but there's a lot of support, videos, and templates to choose from to make your first project easier until you learn the ropes.

I feel like it's obvious, but I'm working on a crochet pattern for Hades as we speak. Hopefully, it'll be released soon-ish and I will bundle the pair at a discount.

For now, I hope you have fun crocheting Persephone, and be sure to tag me in all your creations!
