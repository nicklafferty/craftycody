About a month ago, I told a good friend of mine that I was going on a short trip and wouldn't be around for our weekly movie night. She asked if I had read or heard of Lore Olympus. I told her I got ads for it, but didn't really know what it was about let alone read it.

That all changed.

I read it on the plane and in the evenings during my trip. I had such a lovely backlog that I'd spend a chunk of my afternoons casually reading in the sunroom after I got back home.

I hadn't realized I reached the end until I hit "next episode" and it asked if I wanted to pay to get the next episode early. I was devastated.

So, now I'm stuck waiting week to week like everyone else.
