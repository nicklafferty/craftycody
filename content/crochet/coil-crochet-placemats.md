This is going to sound silly, but I've been hunting for placemats for a couple of months now. They either don't fit with the vision I have in my head or they are too expensive. I only need them once a year so I didn't want to blow a bunch of money on pre-made junk.

So I decided to blow money on _crafting_.

I had an idea in my head that I wanted a boho vibe with a little rustic thrown in. Neutral-toned rainbows are popular right now and I have to admit that I agree with the trend. I think they're super cute so that's the shape I decided on for my placemats.

I will note that doing a circle or rectangle would have been a _lot_ easier so keep that in mind as you read.

I've also never done coil crochet but thought it would be the best way to join the rope strands together. I watched about two seconds of a video to learn how to start the coil and all it is is a magic circle and I thought I could wing the rest.

And I did okay for the most part! :P

This post and accompanying video will lay out the trial and error I went through making this placemat. It's really too bad I need five more.

## Supplies:

1. Rope (6 yards, 3/8in thick)
2. Yarn (Cotton yarn, any color. I used dark grey)
3. Crochet hook (H-5mm hook)
4. Scissors
5. E600 glue
