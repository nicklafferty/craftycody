This is going to sound silly, but I've been hunting for placemats for a couple of months now. They either don't fit with the vision I have in my head or they are too expensive. I only need them once a year so I didn't want to blow a bunch of money on pre-made junk.

So I decided to blow money on _crafting_.

I had an idea in my head that I wanted a boho vibe with a little rustic thrown in. Neutral-toned rainbows are popular right now and I have to admit that I agree with the trend. I think they're super cute so that's the shape I decided on for my placemats.

I will note that doing a circle or rectangle would have been a _lot_ easier so keep that in mind as you read.

I admittedly went to Walmart because I knew they would have all the supplies immediately ready. The rope was about $5/package (I bought two) and the yarn was about $1.60 which was a lot more reasonable. I would suggest [ordering in bulk on Amazon](https://amzn.to/3Q9siFo). You'll get a way better deal especially if you need to make several of these.

I've also never done coil crochet but thought it would be the best way to join the rope strands together. I watched about two seconds of a video to learn how to start the coil and all it is is a magic circle and I thought I could wing the rest.

And I did okay for the most part! :P

This post and accompanying video will lay out the trial and error I went through making this placemat. It's really too bad I need five more.

## Supplies:

1. Rope (6 yards, 3/8in thick)
2. Yarn (Cotton, weight 4, dark grey)
3. Crochet hook (H-5mm hook)
4. Scissors
5. E600 glue

## How-to:

You can use any thickness of rope and color of yarn you'd like. Also, be aware that 6 yards might not be enough to get the desired size. This was a total experiment for me, so learn from my mistakes!
