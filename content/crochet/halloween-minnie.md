[The Halloween Minnie crochet pattern is now available in my Etsy shop!](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1325350105/halloween-minnie-mouse-crochet-pattern)

Spooky Minnie is done just in time for Halloween! 2022, at least. She's been in the making for over a year and I just completed her. Really what took me so long was sewing her together- that's my least favorite part of amigurumi and stuffed animals.

She's a variation of my [Holiday Minnie](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1201547973/holiday-minnie-mouse-crochet-pattern) design but comes with several unique wardrobe changes and colorways.

## Design

Minnie is inspired by the 2020 Disney Halloween series. I am obsessed with the vintage feel from her off-white fur to her pie eyes. It's the same vibe and reason I did the Holiday Minnie last year. Her details are simple to work up, but they add so much and complete her look. My favorite is the Disney villain buttons I found at Walmart!

## Supplies

### Yarn

1. Red Heat Super Saver in Black, Aran, and Pale Plum
2. I Love this Yarn! in Desert Glaze
3. Big Twist in Butter

You can use any weight 4 yarn you'd like. The basic colors are black, off-white, lavender, orange, and yellow. You won't use an entire skein of any of these yarns.

### Hook

* I-9 5.5mm hook

### Misc.

1. Yarn needle
2. Black felt
3. Polyfill stuffing
4. Stitch markers
