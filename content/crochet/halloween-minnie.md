Spooky Minnie is done just in time for Halloween! 2022, at least. She's been in the making for over a year and I just completed her. Really what took me so long was sewing her together- that's my least favorite part of amigurumi and stuffed animals.

She's a variation of my [Holiday Minnie](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1201547973/holiday-minnie-mouse-crochet-pattern) design but comes with several unique wardrobe changes and colorways.
