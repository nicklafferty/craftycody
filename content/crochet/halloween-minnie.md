Spooky Minnie is done just in time for Halloween! 2022, at least. She's been in the making for over a year and I just completed her. Really what took me so long was sewing her together- that's my least favorite part of amigurumi and stuffed animals.

She's a variation of my Holiday Minnie design but comes with several unique wardrobe changes and colorways.
