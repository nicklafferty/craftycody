## Merry Christmas!

Edit: I just [added a PDF version to my store](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/corgi-coffee-amigurumi) if you’d like to donate to the yarn fund!

I have been off this whole last week and I’m off all of next week because I could not be more done or enjoying myself more than I am right now.

My Xmas break has been absolutely wonderful. I have gotten to see all of my greatest friends and spent a healthy amount of time with my family. I wish it could last forever, but I’m so thankful and full of love. I hope this holiday season has brought happiness to all of you as well.

We got back to Austin yesterday and I was bitten by the craft bug today. I shot a couple of videos that I will upload someday and I’ve crocheted a few friends. One is based on a keychain I saw while shopping this last week. I could not justify the price, but I figured I could put my skills to the test and make something similar.

He’s a little corgi inside of a (boba) cup! Or maybe Puppuccino cup? Haha, he didn’t turn out _quite_ like I thought in my head, buuuuut I think I got him to an acceptably cute place. Pattern below:

### Supplies + Tips

Worsted Weight Yarn  
E Hook  
Felt (black and white)  
Scissors  
Yarn needle for sewing and weaving in ends

SC- Single crochet  
BLO – Back loop only  
Dec – single crochet decrease or single crochet 2 together  
Inc – single crochet increase or 2 single crochet in one stitch  
Sts – stiches  
MC – Main color yarn  
OC – other color yarn

I used worsted weight yarn and an E hook because I don’t keep much lighter weight yarns around and I didn’t want this to be huge. Wanted to be able to attach a keychain and hook it onto a backpack, but didn’t want a stuffed animal hanging off of it. You can pick any colors you’d like and please experiment a little with sizing as this is not a perfect pattern.

### Assembly

Attach the head to the cup  
Sew ears on sides of head  
Glue or sew felt pieces onto face  
Attach scarf

There was definitely a lot of trial and error with this one so just have fun with it! I may refine later on, but as I said, I think I got him to a good place. It was really the last-minute addition of the scarf that did it. I was feeling pretty defeated before that!
