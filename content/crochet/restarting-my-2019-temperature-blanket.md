New year, new me, new blanket. I made a post about this several months ago, but I just picked it back up this evening and made 10 more hexagons. I’m almost done with January. Almost. Then, only 11 more months to go. This thing practically makes itself.

These are the two styles of hexagons I’m using. I decided to make the majority of it the [simpler of the two](https://makeanddocrew.com/basic-crochet-hexagon-pattern/) for speed and yarn’s sake. Figure I can get it done slightly faster if each tile isn’t taking me 20 minutes. The other is the [flower power hexagon](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/flower-power-hexagon) available on Ravelry.

I’ll post another photo when January is all put together. 8 billion more hexagons to go.

Update January 2021: Still not done. :P
