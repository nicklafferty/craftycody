I was feeling creative, but I didn't want to start a big, new project. Something small was in order. So, I decided to scroll through Pinterest and try to find some inspiration for a new phone case. There were a lot of cute ideas, but not _exactly_ what I was wanting.

As always, I decided to make my own and you can too.
