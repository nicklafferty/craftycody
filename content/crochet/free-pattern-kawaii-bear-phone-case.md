+++
I felt creative but didn't want to start a big, new project. Something small was in order. So, I decided to scroll through Pinterest and try to find some inspiration for a new phone case. There were a lot of cute ideas, but they were not _exactly_ what I was wanting.

As always, I decided to make my own and you can too.

## Materials

1. G-hook
2. Light brown, pink, black, and white yarn (all weight 4)
3. Yarn needle

## Abbrev.

SC - single crochet  
MR - magic ring  
Inc - increase  
Sts - stitch  
Ch - chain  
Slst - slip stitch  
RND - round  
ROW - row

## Pattern

As a note, I have a **Pixel 7** so that's what this case fits. It's easily customizable, however. Make a starting chain as wide as your phone then crochet as many rounds up as you need to get the right height.

### Case

In light brown.

**Ch. 14**

**RND 1:** 3 SC inc in 2nd chain from hook  
\-SC across until last ch.  
\-3 SC inc in last ch. and turn  
\-Then SC along opposite side of starting chain until you reach first SC inc.

**RND 2-??:** SC around until you reach desired height. Mine is about 27 rounds.

### Ears (make 2)

In light brown

**6 SC in MR**

**ROW 1:** Ch. 1 and turn. Inc around (12 sts)

Finish off and leave long tail for sewing.

### Snout

In white

**6 SC in MR**

**RND 1:** Inc around (12 sts)

**RND 2:** (SC, Inc) around (18 sts)

Finish off and leave long tail for sewing.
