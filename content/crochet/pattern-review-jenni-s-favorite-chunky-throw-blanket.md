Whenever I find blanket yarn on sale, I immediately search patterns on Ravelry. Michaels had them on sale for $5.99/skein which is almost half off.

I found [Jenni's Favorite Chunky Throw Blanket](http://byjennidesigns.blogspot.com/2016/12/jennisfavoritechunkythrowblanket.html) for free and the yarn requirement was low- rare for a blanket. It listed 880 yards which is about four skeins of Bernat blanket yarn. My total for the day was $24.

I picked this totally cute, soft pink color and they, thankfully, had enough for the pattern. All too often you'll find a color you like and they'll only have one or two skeins.

All this being said, I did run out of yarn before I finished the pattern which made me grumpy. I typically crochet quite tight (I try to keep my stitches loose!) so I usually have leftover yarn and a smaller finished project.

I knew I was running low, so I cut the blanket short and still ran out before finished the border.

## Review

I'll be honest, there really isn't a lot to review. That's a good thing though! The whole blanket is made of one repeating row over and over again. What I like most about these kinds of patterns is that I can watch TV or hold a conversation while doing them. The simple repetition also ensures it works up quickly.

She gives three options for a border at the end and they all look very nice. A border really completes the blanket. I chose the ribbed border for my blanket.

## Yarn

As I said above, Michaels was having a sale on [Bernat Baby Blanket](https://www.michaels.com/bernat-baby-blanket-yarn/M20003611.html?dwvar_M20003611_size=10.5%20oz&dwvar_M20003611_color=Light%20Sky) yarn and I bought four skeins in tan pink for $24.

I _love_ blanket yarn. It's one of my favorites to work with. There are no strands for the hook to go through and it's satisfying how quickly projects work up. Plus it's incredibly soft and cozy.

I wish I could do more projects using it, but it gets expensive so quickly.
