I have been crocheting like a madwoman since getting back from Christmas break. It’s been amazing. I think I’ve finished around 10 projects and that is a first. Work is incredibly slow right now and I couldn’t be more thankful. I know I’ve complained in previous posts, but I was working 12-15 hour days for the last 3-4 months so this is a very welcome reprieve. Now I’m at 1-2 hours. So. Nice.

I’ve been filling that time with some crazy crafting/crochet and I finally made a project that I’ve had my eye on for a long time. It’s the [Tea House Wrap by Two of Wands](https://www.twoofwands.com/blog/tea-house-wrap). Just a huge, Lenny Kravitz style wrap that feels so snuggly and I just love how it turned out. Wasn’t sure about the colors at first, but I think they work when it’s all said and done.

I don’t have the same wonderfully arty photos Two of Wands does, but I do have a photo of the finished product on my bed. I can’t wait to wear it out on a day date with my husband. Hopefully, that will be soon because it was literally almost 80 degrees today because Texas.

The colors remind me of a cafe or sweets shop. Like a 1970s cake, I don’t know. I love it. It’s big. It’s squishy. It’s not super tacky like most of the colors I choose for some reason. I had to add some rows to get it to the length she suggests on the pattern. My project always comes out smaller than the gauge no matter how big I make my stitches or what hook I use.

Anyway, hope you guys are inspired to make your own wraps to wear around this chilly season. There is also a [knit version](https://www.twoofwands.com/blog/coffee-shop-wrap) if that is your jam as well :D.
