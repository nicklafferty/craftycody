SHE'S DONE!

PATTERN POSTED!

MERRY CHRISTMAS!

Minnie took me over a year to get finished. The crochet part was easy- it was writing the pattern that took me forever. I've never written one so detailed before and I'm hoping it's clear and simple enough to follow. She was a labor of love.

She's based on the Yuletide series Disney did a year or so ago. I worked hard making her unique and adding small details that make her look like you bought her from a store. But you didn't- you made her! She's truly one of a kind.

I would love it if you all tried your hand at making her and posting her on social media. Give me a tag if you do! This pattern really means a lot to me and is probably one of the best things I've ever crocheted.
