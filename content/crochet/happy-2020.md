Happy New Year (6 days late)! Yay!

Hope everyone had a safe and wonderful New Year. What kinds of resolutions did you make? I don’t usually make any, but this year I wanted to start using a (cute) planner. I thought I’d be super creative and make a bullet journal, but I knew I _might_ complete one month then that would be it. I bought one that was already adorabled-out and figured if I just wrote in it (and used the stickers) then that’d be a good start.

So far so good! Been keeping notes every day and even filled out the “goals” section for January. Six days in and I’ve been keeping at it so fingers crossed.

One of my goals was to actually finish some of my on-going crochet projects- of which there are _plenty._ I’ve already finished two! One out of a self-imposed time crunch (everyone works better under stress, right?) and the other because I was on a roll after the first.

The first is this[ ultra-cute fox lovey by TillySome.](https://www.etsy.com/listing/594764559/sleepy-fox-lovey-pattern-security?gpla=1&gao=1&utm_campaign=shopping_us_TillySome_sfc_osa&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&utm_custom1=0&utm_content=12154653&gclid=CjwKCAiA0svwBRBhEiwAHqKjFu4v9yttxUfK5Rz1tM8B0sJ13RiskJdz_xvNNUJAw8aubK9wYEGWnRoCxhgQAvD_BwE) It. Took. Me. Forever. And that is completely on me. I made it for some friends of ours second baby. Their first got one as well when she was born, so I figured fair’s fair. Boy that was a mistake, haha. The pattern itself is written very well, but with all the color changes and sewing different pieces, it just took me months to finish. Luckily (or not) we don’t see them too often, so when we all decided to get together this past weekend I knew I had to bite the bullet and finish. And I did! Thank goodness!

Next is my sweet Harry from [Animal Friends of Pica Pau.](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9491643193/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=codybear0e-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=9491643193&linkId=4a597def6a0625b1a8f6d3b222ca36f0) One of those books you see a ton of people crocheting from and decide you want in on all the cute animals too! I just finished him up tonight and it was also very well written, yet quite involved. I’m looking forward to making more animals though.

What is everyone else working on? Start a new project in the New Year? Finishing previous ones?
